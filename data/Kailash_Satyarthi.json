    "In 2014, he was the co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize , along with Malala Yousafzai , \"for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.\" He is the founder of multiple social activist organizations, including Bachpan Bachao Andolan , Global March Against Child Labour , Global Campaign for Education , Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation, and Bal Ashram Trust.",
    "Kailash Satyarthi and his team at Bachpan Bachao Andolan have liberated more than 1,30,000 children in India from child labour , slavery and trafficking . In 1998, Satyarthi conceived and led the Global March against Child Labour, an 80,000 km (ca. 49,710 mi)-long march across 103 countries to put forth a global demand against worst forms of child labour. This became one of the largest social movements ever on behalf of exploited children. The demands of the marchers, which included children and youth (particularly the survivors of trafficking for forced labor, exploitation, sexual abuse, illegal organ transplants, armed conflict, etc.) were reflected in the draft of the ILO Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour. The following year, the Convention was unanimously adopted at the ILO Conference in Geneva.",

    "Satyarthi was born as Kailash Sharma in Vidisha , Madhya Bharat ,   a small town in the (now) Madhya Pradesh state Of India. He dropped his last name Sharma (implying that he is a Brahmin ) and took Satyarthi (meaning one who longs for truth) after his marriage, due to the influence of the reformist Arya Samaj movement. Kailash Satyarthi belongs to a middle-class family. He is the youngest among four brothers and a sister in his family. His father Ramprasad Sharma was a retired police head constable and his mother Chironjibai was an uneducated housewife with high morals. As per Satyarthi, the exceptionally idealistic and helpful nature of his mother had a big impact on him. He was raised in a locality ( mohalla ) where Hindus and Muslims lived with each other. As a four-year-old toddler, he learnt to read Urdu from the Maulvi at the neighboring mosque and learnt Hindi and English in his school.",
    "Satyarthi was significantly affected by the lack of school access for all children and his experiences with poverty in his youth. He made efforts when he was young to try to change these inequalities due to the circumstances of their birth.",

In the late 1980s and early 1990s he focused its campaigns on raising consumer awareness on issues relating to the accountability of global corporations regarding socially responsible consumerism , trade and supply chains. Satyarthi has highlighted child labour as a human rights issue as well as a welfare matter and charitable cause. He has argued that it perpetuates poverty , unemployment , illiteracy , population growth, and other social problems, his claims have been supported by several studies.

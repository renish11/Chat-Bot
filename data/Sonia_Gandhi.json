    "Sonia Gandhi ( Hindi: [ˈsoːnɪjaː ˈɡaːndʱiː] , Italian: [ˈsɔːnja ˈɡandi] ; née Maino [ˈmaino] ; born 9 December 1946) is an Indian politician. She is the longest-serving president of the Indian National Congress , a big-tent liberal political party, which has governed India for most of its post-independence history. She took over as the party leader in 1998, seven years after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi , her husband and a former Prime Minister of India , and remained in office until 2017 after serving for twenty-two years. She returned to the post as interim president in 2019 and remained the President for another three years.",
    "Born in a small village near Vicenza , Italy, Gandhi was raised in a Roman Catholic family. After completing her primary education at local schools, she moved for language classes to Cambridge , England, where she met Rajiv Gandhi , and later married him in 1968. She then moved to India and started living with her mother-in-law, the then- Prime Minister of India , Indira Gandhi , at the latter's New Delhi residence. Sonia Gandhi, however, kept away from the public sphere , even during the years of her husband's premiership.",
    "Following her husband's assassination, Gandhi was invited by Congress leaders to lead the party, but she declined. She agreed to join politics in 1997 after much pleading from the party; the following year, she was nominated for party president . Under her leadership, the Congress went on to form the government post the 2004 elections in coalition with other centre-left political parties. Gandhi has since been credited for being instrumental in formulating the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), which was re-elected to power in 2009 . Gandhi declined the premiership following the 2004 victory; she instead led the ruling alliance and the National Advisory Council .",
    "Over the course of her career, Gandhi presided over the advisory councils credited for the formation and subsequent implementation of such rights-based development and welfare schemes as the Right to Information , Food Security Bill , and MGNREGA , as she drew criticism related to the National Herald case during the Manmohan Singh premiership. Her foreign birth has also been a subject of much debate and controversy. Gandhi's active participation in politics began to reduce during the latter half of the UPA government's second term owing to health concerns. She stepped down as the Congress president in December 2017 but returned to lead the party in August 2019.",
    "Although she has not held any public office in the government of India , Gandhi has been widely described as one of the most powerful politicians in the country, and is often listed among the most powerful women in the world.",
    "Sonia Maino was born on 9 December 1946 to Stefano and Paola Maino in Lusiana (in Maini street), a historically Cimbrian -speaking village about 35 km from Vicenza in Veneto , Italy . She was one of three siblings: Sonia, Nadia and Anoushka, raised in a traditional Roman Catholic Christian family. Sonia spent her adolescence in Orbassano , a town near Turin . She attained primary education attending the local Catholic schools; one of her early teachers described her as \"a diligent little girl, [who] studied as much as was necessary\".",
    "Stefano, who was a building mason, established a small construction business in Orbassano. It is alleged that in an interview with Jawid Laiq published in Outlook in 1998 Stefano claimed that he had fought against the Soviet military alongside Hitler 's Wehrmacht on the eastern front in World War II , and that he was a loyal supporter of Benito Mussolini and Italy's National Fascist Party . As per the said article, the family house had leather bound books on writings and speeches of Mussolini. Stefano had named Sonia and her elder sister Nadia in the memory of the Italian participation in the Eastern Front . He died in 1983. Gandhi has two sisters who still reside in Orbassano.",
    "Gandhi completed her schooling at the age of 13; her final report card read: \"intelligent, diligent, committed [...] would succeed well at the high school for teachers\". She aspired to become a flight attendant . In 1964, she went to study English at the Bell Educational Trust 's language school in the city of Cambridge . The following year, she met Rajiv Gandhi at the Varsity Restaurant, where she was working as a part-time waitress, while he was enrolled for an engineering degree in the Trinity College at the University of Cambridge . In this context, the Times , London reported, \"Mrs Gandhi was an 18-year-old student at a small language college in Cambridge in 1965, [...] when she met a handsome young engineering student\". The couple married in 1968, in a Hindu ceremony, following which she moved into the house of her mother-in-law and then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi .",
    "The couple had two children, Rahul Gandhi (born 1970) and Priyanka Vadra (born 1972). Despite belonging to the influential Nehru family , Sonia and Rajiv avoided all involvement in politics. Rajiv worked as an airline pilot while Sonia took care of her family.\nShe spent considerable amount of time with her mother-in-law, Indira Gandhi; she recalled her experience in a 1985 interview with the Hindi-language magazine Dharmyug , \"She [Indira] showered me with all her affection and love\". Soon after the latter's ousting from office in 1977 in the aftermath of the Indian Emergency , the Rajiv family contemplated moving abroad for a short time. When Rajiv entered politics in 1982 after the death of his younger brother Sanjay Gandhi in a plane crash on 23 June 1980, Sonia continued to focus on her family and avoided all contact with the public.",
    "Sonia Gandhi's involvement with Indian public life began after the assassination of her mother-in-law and her husband's election as prime minister. As the prime minister's wife she acted as his official hostess and also accompanied him on a number of state visits.",
    "In 1984, she actively campaigned against her husband's sister-in-law Maneka Gandhi who was running against Rajiv in Amethi . At the end of Rajiv Gandhi's five years in office, the Bofors scandal broke out. Ottavio Quattrocchi , an Italian businessman believed to be involved, was said to be a friend of Sonia Gandhi, having access to the Prime Minister's official residence. The BJP has alleged that she appeared on the voters' list in New Delhi prior to obtaining Indian citizenship in April 1983, in contravention of Indian law.",
    "Former senior Congress leader and former President of India Pranab Mukherjee said that she surrendered her Italian passport to the Italian Embassy on 27 April 1983. Italian nationality law did not permit dual nationality until 1992. So, by acquiring Indian citizenship on 30 April 1983, she would automatically have lost Italian citizenship.",
    "After Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in 1991 and Sonia Gandhi refused to succeed him as the Congress president and prime minister, the party settled on the choice of P. V. Narasimha Rao who subsequently became Prime Minister after winning elections that year . Over the next few years, however, the Congress fortunes continued to dwindle and it lost the 1996 elections . Several senior leaders such as Madhavrao Sindhia , Rajesh Pilot , Narayan Dutt Tiwari , Arjun Singh , Mamata Banerjee , G. K. Moopanar , P. Chidambaram and Jayanthi Natarajan were in open revolt against incumbent President Sitaram Kesri and many of whom quit the party, splitting the Congress into many factions.",

    "In May 1999, three senior leaders of the party ( Sharad Pawar , P. A. Sangma , and Tariq Anwar ) challenged her right to try to become India's Prime Minister because of her foreign origins. In response, she offered to resign as party leader, resulting in an outpouring of support and the expulsion from the party of the three rebels who went on to form the Nationalist Congress Party .",

In 2000, she defeated Jitendra Prasada by a huge margin of 97% in the Congress President Election. She had been repeatedly selected for the position without any election being held. As Leader of the Opposition, she called a no-confidence motion against the NDA government led by Vajpayee in 2003.",
    "In the 2004 general elections , Gandhi launched a nationwide campaign, crisscrossing the country on the Aam Aadmi (ordinary man) slogan in contrast to the 'India Shining' slogan of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) alliance. She countered the BJP asking \"Who is India Shining for?\". In the election, she was re-elected by a 200,000-vote margin over her nearest rival, in the Rae Bareli . Following the unexpected defeat of the NDA, she was widely expected to be the next Prime Minister of India . On 16 May, she was unanimously chosen to lead a coalition government of 15 parties supported by the left, and it was subsequently named as United Progressive Alliance (UPA).",

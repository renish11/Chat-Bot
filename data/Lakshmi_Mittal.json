    "Lakshmi's father, Mohanlal Mittal, ran a steel business, Nippon Denro Ispat. In 1976, because of the curb of steel production by the Indian government, the 26-year-old Mittal opened his first steel factory PT Ispat Indo in Sidoarjo , East Java , Indonesia .",
    "In 1989 Mittal purchased the state-owned steel works in Trinidad and Tobago , which were operating at an enormous loss. He turned them into profitable ventures in a year.",

Today, the family business, including a large integrated steel plant near Mumbai , is run by his younger brothers Pramod Mittal and Vinod Mittal, but Lakshmi has no connection with it.",
    "In 1995 Mittal purchased the Irish Steel plant based in Cork , Ireland , from the government for a nominal fee of IR£ 1. Only six years later in 2001 it was closed, leaving over 400 people redundant. Subsequent environmental issues at the site have been a cause for criticism. The Irish government sought a High Court judgement that Mittal's company should contribute to the cost of the clean-up of Cork Harbour , but failed. The clean up was expected to cost €70 million.",
    "Prior to December 2001, Mittal had acquired assets which he renamed Ispat Mexicana and his Kazakhstani operation Ispat Karmet. That month he renamed Sidex Galati to Ispat Sidex, which he had acquired in November 2001.",

    "In 2002, Plaid Cymru MP Adam Price obtained a letter written by Tony Blair to the Romanian Government in support of Mittal's LNM Group steel company, which was in the process of bidding to buy Romania's state-owned industry. This revelation caused controversy, because Mittal had given £125,000 to the British Labour Party the previous year. Although Blair defended his letter as simply \"celebrating the success\" of a British company, he was criticised because LNM was registered in the Dutch Antilles and employed less than 1% of its workforce in the UK. LNM was a \"major global competitor of Britain's own struggling steel industry\".",
    "Blair's letter hinted that the privatisation of the firm and sale to Mittal might help smooth the way for Romania's entry into the European Union . It also had a passage, removed just prior to Blair's signing of it, describing Mittal as \"a friend\".",

However, on 20 December 2007, it was announced that the Mittal family had purchased a 20 per cent shareholding in Queens Park Rangers football club joining Flavio Briatore and Mittal's friend Bernie Ecclestone . As part of the investment Mittal's son-in-law, Amit Bhatia, took a place on the board of directors. The combined investment in the struggling club sparked suggestions that Mittal might be looking to join the growing ranks of wealthy individuals investing heavily in English football and emulating similar benefactors such as Roman Abramovich . On 19 February 2010, Briatore resigned as QPR chairman, and sold further shares in the club to Ecclestone, making Ecclestone the single largest shareholder.",

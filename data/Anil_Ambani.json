    "Anil Ambani is married to the actress Tina Munim . He married her after facing much resistance from his family, because she came from the world of fashion and glamour, and her lifestyle choices before marriage had been unconventional. Nevertheless, the couple have had a stable marriage and have two sons, Jai Anmol Ambani and Jai Anshul Ambani. As of 2010, Ambani and his family reside at The Sea Wind, a 14-story building in Mumbai.

Ambani, several of whose companies are debt-ridden, has denied all charges of benefiting from crony capitalism . In factual terms, Reliance Defence stood to get just over 3 per cent of the ₹ 30,000 crore (equivalent to ₹ 400 billion or US$4.7 billion in 2023) Dassault Aviation offsets contract, contrary to the impression that it was to be the biggest beneficiary of the Rafale fighter jet deal.",

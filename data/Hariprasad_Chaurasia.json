    "Hariprasad Chaurasia (born 1 July 1938) is an Indian music director and classical flautist, who plays the bansuri , in the Hindustani classical tradition .",
    "Chaurasia was born in Allahabad (1938) (present day Prayagraj ) in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh . His mother died when he was six years old. He had to learn music without his father's knowledge, as his father wanted him to become a wrestler. Chaurasia did go to the Akhada and trained with his father for some time, although he also started learning music and practising at his friend's house.",
    "He has stated,",
    "I was not any good at wrestling. I went there only to please my father. But maybe because of his strength and stamina, I'm able to play the bansuri even to this day.",
    "Chaurasia started learning vocal music from his neighbour, Rajaram, at the age of 15. Later, he switched to playing the flute under the tutelage of Bholanath Prasanna of Varanasi for eight years. He joined the All India Radio , Cuttack , Odisha in 1957 and worked as a composer and performer. Much later, while working for All India Radio, he received guidance from the reclusive Annapurna Devi , daughter of Baba Allaudin Khan . She only agreed to teach him if he was willing to unlearn all that he had learnt until then. Another version is that she only agreed to teach him after he took the decision to switch from right-handed to left-handed playing to show her his commitment. In any case Chaurasia plays left-handed to this day.",

The pair composed music for many popular movies, including Silsila and Chandni, and created some highly popular songs. Chaurasia also collaborated with Bhubaneswar Mishra , forming the pair \"Bhuban-Hari\" (in line with Shiv-Hari), and the pair composed music for many Odia movies, creating numerous songs that were hugely popular in the state. These include Muje janena kaha baata (sung by Suman Kalyanpur ; movie: Gapa helebi Sata); and all songs from Maa o Mamata, and many more.",

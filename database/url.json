  "answer": "A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a web address that provides a unique, specific location for a particular resource on the internet. It contains information about what you're looking for as well as the protocol used to access it. URLs are typically used to locate web pages, but they can also be used to locate other resources such as images, videos, audio files and documents. In other words, URLs make it possible to identify where something is located online so that you can view or download it."

  "Take a deep breath. Then thank a plant. If you eat fruit, vegetables, grains or potatoes, thank a plant too. Plants and algae provide us with the oxygen we need to survive, as well as the carbohydrates we use for energy. They do it all through photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process of creating sugar and oxygen from carbon dioxide, water and sunlight. It happens through a long series of chemical reactions. But it can be summarized like this: Carbon dioxide, water and light go in. Glucose, water and oxygen come out. (Glucose is a simple sugar.) Photosynthesis can be split into two processes. The “photo” part refers to reactions triggered by light. “Synthesis” — the making of the sugar — is a separate process called the Calvin cycle. Both processes happen inside a chloroplast. This is a specialized structure, or organelle, in a plant cell. The structure contains stacks of membranes called thylakoid membranes. That’s where the light reaction begins. Chloroplasts are found in plant cells. This is where photosynthesis takes place. The chlorophyll molecules that take in energy from sunlight are located in the stacks called thylakoid membranes. blueringmedia/iStock/Getty Images Plus Let the light shine in When light hits a plant’s leaves, it shines on chloroplasts and into their thylakoid membranes. Those membranes are filled with chlorophyll, a green pigment. This pigment absorbs light energy. Light travels as electromagnetic waves. The wavelength — distance between waves — determines energy level. Some of those wavelengths are visible to us as the colors we see. If a molecule, such as chlorophyll, has the right shape, it can absorb the energy from some wavelengths of light. Chlorophyll can absorb light we see as blue and red. That’s why we see plants as green. Green is the wavelength plants reflect, not the color they absorb. While light travels as a wave, it also can be a particle called a photon. Photons have no mass. They do, however, have a small amount of light energy. When a photon of light from the sun bounces into a leaf, its energy excites a chlorophyll molecule. That photon starts a process that splits a molecule of water. The oxygen atom that splits off from the water instantly bonds with another, creating a molecule of oxygen, or O2. The chemical reaction also produces a molecule called ATP and another molecule called NADPH. Both of these allow a cell to store energy. The ATP and NADPH also will take part in the synthesis part of photosynthesis. Notice that the light reaction makes no sugar. Instead, it supplies energy — stored in the ATP and NADPH — that gets plugged into the Calvin cycle. This is where sugar is made. But the light reaction does produce something we use: oxygen. All the oxygen we breathe is the result of this step in photosynthesis, carried out by plants and algae (which are not plants) the world over. Give me some sugar The next step takes the energy from the light reaction and applies it to a process called the Calvin cycle. The cycle is named for Melvin Calvin, the man who discovered it. The Calvin cycle is sometimes also called the dark reaction because none of its steps require light. But it still happens during the day. That’s because it needs the energy produced by the light reaction that comes before it. While the light reaction takes place in the thylakoid membranes, the ATP and NADPH it produces end up in the stroma. This is the space inside the chloroplast but outside the thylakoid membranes. The Calvin cycle has four major steps: carbon fixation: Here, the plant brings in CO2 and attaches it to another carbon molecule, using rubisco. This is an enzyme, or chemical that makes reactions move faster. This step is so important that rubisco is the most common protein in a chloroplast — and on Earth. Rubisco attaches the carbon in CO2 to a five-carbon molecule called ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (or RuBP). This creates a six-carbon molecule, which immediately splits into two chemicals, each with three carbons.reduction: The ATP and NADPH from the light reaction pop in and transform the two three-carbon molecules into two small sugar molecules. The sugar molecules are called G3P. That’s short for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GLIH- sur-AAL-duh-hide 3-FOS-fayt).carbohydrate formation: Some of that G3P leaves the cycle to be converted into bigger sugars such as glucose (C6H12O6).regeneration: With more ATP from the continuing light reaction, leftover G3P picks up two more carbons to become RuBP. This RuBP pairs up with rubisco again. They are now ready to start the Calvin cycle again when the next molecule of CO2 arrives. At the end of photosynthesis, a plant ends up with glucose (C6H12O6), oxygen (O2) and water (H2O). The glucose molecule goes on to bigger things. It can become part of a long-chain molecule, such as cellulose; that’s the chemical that makes up cell walls. Plants also can store the energy packed in a glucose molecule within larger starch molecules. They can even put the glucose into other sugars — such as fructose — to make a plant’s fruit sweet. All of these molecules are carbohydrates — chemicals containing carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. (CarbOHydrate makes it easy to remember.) The plant uses the bonds in these chemicals to store energy. But we use the these chemicals too. Carbohydrates are an important part of the foods we eat, particularly grains, potatoes, fruits and vegetables. We eat plants for food. But plants make their own food. This video explains how. Power Words More About Power Words algae: Single-celled organisms, once considered plants (they aren’t). As aquatic organisms, they grow in water. Like green plants, they depend on sunlight to make their food. atom: The basic unit of a chemical element. Atoms are made up of a dense nucleus that contains positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons. The nucleus is orbited by a cloud of negatively charged electrons. ATP: Short for adenosine triphosphate. Cells make this molecule to power almost all of their activities. Cells use oxygen and simple sugars to create this molecule, the main source of their energy. The small structures in cells that carry out this energy-storing process are known as mitochondria. Like a battery, ATP stores a bit of usable energy. Once the cell uses it up, mitochondria must recharge the cell by making more ATP using energy harvested from the cell’s nutrients. bond: (in chemistry) A semi-permanent attachment between atoms — or groups of atoms — in a molecule. It’s formed by an attractive force between the participating atoms. Once bonded, the atoms will work as a unit. To separate the component atoms, energy must be supplied to the molecule as heat or some other type of radiation. Calvin cycle: Named for Melvin Calvin, the man who discovered it, this cycle is the process by which plants and algae turn carbon dioxide into basic carbohydrates. carbohydrates: Any of a large group of compounds occurring in foods and living tissues, including sugars, starch and cellulose. They contain hydrogen and oxygen in the same ratio as water (2:1) and typically can be broken down in an animal’s body to release energy. carbon dioxide: (or CO2) A colorless, odorless gas produced by all animals when the oxygen they inhale reacts with the carbon-rich foods that they’ve eaten. Carbon dioxide also is released when organic matter burns (including fossil fuels like oil or gas). Carbon dioxide acts as a greenhouse gas, trapping heat in Earth’s atmosphere. Plants convert carbon dioxide into oxygen during photosynthesis, the process they use to make their own food. cell: The smallest structural and functional unit of an organism. Typically too small to see with the unaided eye, it consists of a watery fluid surrounded by a membrane or wall. Depending on their size, animals are made of anywhere from thousands to trillions of cells. Most organisms, such as yeasts, molds, bacteria and some algae, are composed of only one cell. cellulose: A type of fiber found in plant cell walls. It is formed by chains of glucose molecules. chemical: A substance formed from two or more atoms that unite (bond) in a fixed proportion and structure. For example, water is a chemical made when two hydrogen atoms bond to one oxygen atom. Its chemical formula is H2O. Chemical also can be an adjective to describe properties of materials that are the result of various reactions between different compounds. chemical reaction: A process that involves the rearrangement of the molecules or structure of a substance, as opposed to a change in physical form (as from a solid to a gas). chlorophyll: Any of several green pigments found in plants that perform photosynthesis — creating sugars (foods) from carbon dioxide and water. chloroplast: A tiny structure in the cells of green algae and green plants that contain chlorophyll and creates glucose through photosynthesis. electromagnetic: An adjective referring to light radiation, to magnetism or to both. excite: (in chemistry and physics) To transfer energy to one or more outer electrons in an atom. They remain in this higher energy state until they shed the extra energy through the emission of some type of radiation, such as light. fructose: A simple sugar. Along with glucose, fructose makes up half of each molecule of sucrose (also known as table sugar). glucose: A simple sugar that is an important energy source in living organisms. As an energy source moving through the bloodstream, it is known as “blood sugar.” It is half of the molecule that makes up table sugar (also known as sucrose). glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate or G3P: A molecule created as part of the chemical steps that form simple carbohydrates. Two molecules of G3P are made in plants and algae as part of the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis. Animals and bacteria also create G3P as part of their own steps of making carbohydrate. hydrogen: The lightest element in the universe. As a gas, it is colorless, odorless and highly flammable. It’s an integral part of many fuels, fats and chemicals that make up living tissues. It’s made of a single proton (which serves as its nucleus) orbited by a single electron. mass: A number that shows how much an object resists speeding up and slowing down — basically a measure of how much matter that object is made from. membrane: A barrier which blocks the passage (or flow through) of some materials depending on their size or other features. Membranes are an integral part of filtration systems. Many serve that same function as the outer covering of cells or organs of a body. molecule: An electrically neutral group of atoms that represents the smallest possible amount of a chemical compound. Molecules can be made of single types of atoms or of different types. For example, the oxygen in the air is made of two oxygen atoms (O2), but water is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (H2O). NADPH or NADP+: Short for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (but no one calls it that). This molecule is a way for cells to store and transfer energy. When the NADP+ molecule is transformed to NADPH, it contains energy, which it can then use to power other reactions in a cell. organelle: Specialized structures, such as mitochondria, found within a cell. oxygen: A gas that makes up about 21 percent of Earth's atmosphere. All animals and many microorganisms need oxygen to fuel their growth (and metabolism). particle: A minute amount of something. photon: A particle representing the smallest possible amount of light or other type of electromagnetic radiation. photosynthesis: (verb: photosynthesize) The process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to produce foods from carbon dioxide and water. protein: A compound made from one or more long chains of amino acids. Proteins are an essential part of all living organisms. They form the basis of living cells, muscle and tissues; they also do the work inside of cells. Among the better-known, stand-alone proteins are the hemoglobin (in blood) and the antibodies (also in blood) that attempt to fight infections. Medicines frequently work by latching onto proteins. reduction: (v. reduce) A chemical reaction that adds one or more electrons. It’s also viewed as the opposite of oxidation. As rust oxidizes iron, the process reduces those nearby oxygen atoms. That means that they gain electrons, which have a negative charge. ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate: (RuBP) A molecule that completes the first and last steps of the Calvin cycle, which creates sugar out of carbon dioxide. This molecule contains five carbons and binds to the enzyme rubisco. Rubisco hooks up RuBP with carbon dioxide from the air, the first step in making a carbohydrate. rubisco: This acronym stands for ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. It is the most common protein on Earth. In its role as an enzyme, it plays a pivotal role in photosynthesis. starch: A soft white chemical made by all green plants. It’s a relatively long molecule made from linking together a lot of smaller, identical building blocks — all of them glucose, a simple sugar. Plants and animals use glucose as an energy source. Plants store that glucose, in the form of starch, as a reserve supply of energy. Animals that consume starch can break down the starch into glucose molecules to extract the useful energy. stroma: (in botany) The colorless fluid inside a chloroplast, where the Calvin cycle portion of photosynthesis takes place. (in anatomy) The supportive structure surrounding an organ. It includes the connective tissue that holds the organ in place and the blood vessels that bring the organ oxygen and sugars. synthesis: (v. synthesize) The production of a substance by the combining of simpler chemical building blocks. thylakoid membranes: An internal system of connected membranes inside a chloroplast. The membranes contain not only the green pigment chlorophyll, but also proteins. These membranes are where the light reaction portion of photosynthesis takes place, producing oxygen and energy to power the sugar-making portions of photosynthesis. wavelength: The distance between one peak and the next in a series of waves, or the distance between one trough and the next. It’s also one of the “yardsticks” used to measure radiation. Visible light — which, like all electromagnetic radiation, travels in waves — includes wavelengths between about 380 nanometers (violet) and about 740 nanometers (red). Radiation with wavelengths shorter than visible light includes gamma rays, X-rays and ultraviolet light. Longer-wavelength radiation includes infrared light, microwaves and radio waves.

  "The study of photosynthesis began in 1771 with observations made by the English clergyman and scientist Joseph Priestley. Priestley had burned a candle in a closed container until the air within the container could no longer support combustion. He then placed a sprig of mint plant in the container and discovered that after several days the mint had produced some substance (later recognized as oxygen) that enabled the confined air to again support combustion. In 1779 the Dutch physician Jan Ingenhousz expanded upon Priestley’s work, showing that the plant had to be exposed to light if the combustible substance (i.e., oxygen) was to be restored. He also demonstrated that this process required the presence of the green tissues of the plant.",

It is the way in which virtually all energy in the biosphere becomes available to living things. As primary producers, photosynthetic organisms form the base of Earth’s food webs and are consumed directly or indirectly by all higher life-forms. Additionally, almost all the oxygen in the atmosphere is due to the process of photosynthesis. If photosynthesis ceased, there would soon be little food or other organic matter on Earth, most organisms would disappear, and Earth’s atmosphere would eventually become nearly devoid of gaseous oxygen. What is the basic formula for photosynthesis?The process of photosynthesis is commonly written as: 6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6 + 6O2. This means that the reactants, six carbon dioxide molecules and six water molecules, are converted by light energy captured by chlorophyll (implied by the arrow) into a sugar molecule and six oxygen molecules, the products. The sugar is used by the organism, and the oxygen is released as a by-product. Which organisms can photosynthesize?The ability to photosynthesize is found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. The most well-known examples are plants, as all but a very few parasitic or mycoheterotrophic species contain chlorophyll and produce their own food. Algae are the other dominant group of eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms. All algae, which include massive kelps and microscopic diatoms, are important primary producers. Cyanobacteria and certain sulfur bacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes, in whom photosynthesis evolved. No animals are thought to be independently capable of photosynthesis, though the emerald green sea slug can temporarily incorporate algae chloroplasts in its body for food production.

Most organisms would disappear, and in time Earth’s atmosphere would become nearly devoid of gaseous oxygen.

In past ages, green plants and small organisms that fed on plants increased faster than they were consumed, and their remains were deposited in Earth’s crust by sedimentation and other geological processes. There, protected from oxidation, these organic remains were slowly converted to fossil fuels. These fuels not only provide much of the energy used in factories, homes, and transportation but also serve as the raw material for plastics and other synthetic products. Unfortunately, modern civilization is using up in a few centuries the excess of photosynthetic production accumulated over millions of years. Consequently, the carbon dioxide that has been removed from the air to make carbohydrates in photosynthesis over millions of years is being returned at an incredibly rapid rate. The carbon dioxide concentration in Earth’s atmosphere is rising the fastest it ever has in Earth’s history, and this phenomenon is expected to have major implications on Earth’s climate.Requirements for food, materials, and energy in a world where human population is rapidly growing have created a need to increase both the amount of photosynthesis and the efficiency of converting photosynthetic output into products useful to people. One response to those needs—the so-called Green Revolution, begun in the mid-20th century—achieved enormous improvements in agricultural yield through the use of chemical fertilizers, pest and plant-disease control, plant breeding, and mechanized tilling, harvesting, and crop processing. This effort limited severe famines to a few areas of the world despite rapid population growth, but it did not eliminate widespread malnutrition. Moreover, beginning in the early 1990s, the rate at which yields of major crops increased began to decline. This was especially true for rice in Asia. Rising costs associated with sustaining high rates of agricultural production, which required ever-increasing inputs of fertilizers and pesticides and constant development of new plant varieties, also became problematic for farmers in many countries.A second agricultural revolution, based on plant genetic engineering, was forecast to lead to increases in plant productivity and thereby partially alleviate malnutrition. Since the 1970s, molecular biologists have possessed the means to alter a plant’s genetic material (deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA) with the aim of achieving improvements in disease and drought resistance, product yield and quality, frost hardiness, and other desirable properties. However, such traits are inherently complex, and the process of making changes to crop plants through genetic engineering has turned out to be more complicated than anticipated. In the future such genetic engineering may result in improvements in the process of photosynthesis, but by the first decades of the 21st century, it had yet to demonstrate that it could dramatically increase crop yields. Britannica Quiz Pop Quiz: 13 Things to Know About Photosynthesis Another intriguing area in the study of photosynthesis has been the discovery that certain animals are able to convert light energy into chemical energy. The emerald green sea slug (Elysia chlorotica), for example, acquires genes and chloroplasts from Vaucheria litorea, an alga it consumes, giving it a limited ability to produce chlorophyll. When enough chloroplasts are assimilated, the slug may forgo the ingestion of food. The pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) can harness light to manufacture the energy-rich compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP); this ability has been linked to the aphid’s manufacture of carotenoid pigments. General characteristics Development of the idea The study of photosynthesis began in 1771 with observations made by the English clergyman and scientist Joseph Priestley. Priestley had burned a candle in a closed container until the air within the container could no longer support combustion. He then placed a sprig of mint plant in the container and discovered that after several days the mint had produced some substance (later recognized as oxygen) that enabled the confined air to again support combustion. In 1779 the Dutch physician Jan Ingenhousz expanded upon Priestley’s work, showing that the plant had to be exposed to light if the combustible substance (i.e., oxygen) was to be restored. He also demonstrated that this process required the presence of the green tissues of the plant. Get Unlimited Access Try Britannica Premium for free and discover more. Subscribe In 1782 it was demonstrated that the combustion-supporting gas (oxygen) was formed at the expense of another gas, or “fixed air,” which had been identified the year before as carbon dioxide. Gas-exchange experiments in 1804 showed that the gain in weight of a plant grown in a carefully weighed pot resulted from the uptake of carbon, which came entirely from absorbed carbon dioxide, and water taken up by plant roots; the balance is oxygen, released back to the atmosphere. Almost half a century passed before the concept of chemical energy had developed sufficiently to permit the discovery (in 1845) that light energy from the sun is stored as chemical energy in products formed during photosynthesis. Overall reaction of photosynthesis In chemical terms, photosynthesis is a light-energized oxidation–reduction process. (Oxidation refers to the removal of electrons from a molecule; reduction refers to the gain of electrons by a molecule.) In plant photosynthesis, the energy of light is used to drive the oxidation of water (H2O), producing oxygen gas (O2), hydrogen ions (H+), and electrons. Most of the removed electrons and hydrogen ions ultimately are transferred to carbon dioxide (CO2), which is reduced to organic products. Other electrons and hydrogen ions are used to reduce nitrate and sulfate to amino and sulfhydryl groups in amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. In most green cells, carbohydrates—especially starch and the sugar sucrose—are the major direct organic products of photosynthesis. The overall reaction in which carbohydrates—represented by the general formula (CH2O)—are formed during plant photosynthesis can be indicated by the following equation: This equation is merely a summary statement, for the process of photosynthesis actually involves numerous reactions catalyzed by enzymes (organic catalysts). These reactions occur in two stages: the “light” stage, consisting of photochemical (i.e., light-capturing) reactions; and the “dark” stage, comprising chemical reactions controlled by enzymes. During the first stage, the energy of light is absorbed and used to drive a series of electron transfers, resulting in the synthesis of ATP and the electron-donor-reduced nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). During the dark stage, the ATP and NADPH formed in the light-capturing reactions are used to reduce carbon dioxide to organic carbon compounds. This assimilation of inorganic carbon into organic compounds is called carbon fixation. During the 20th century, comparisons between photosynthetic processes in green plants and in certain photosynthetic sulfur bacteria provided important information about the photosynthetic mechanism. Sulfur bacteria use hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a source of hydrogen atoms and produce sulfur instead of oxygen during photosynthesis. The overall reaction is In the 1930s Dutch biologist Cornelis van Niel recognized that the utilization of carbon dioxide to form organic compounds was similar in the two types of photosynthetic organisms. Suggesting that differences existed in the light-dependent stage and in the nature of the compounds used as a source of hydrogen atoms, he proposed that hydrogen was transferred from hydrogen sulfide (in bacteria) or water (in green plants) to an unknown acceptor (called A), which was reduced to H2A. During the dark reactions, which are similar in both bacteria and green plants, the reduced acceptor (H2A) reacted with carbon dioxide (CO2) to form carbohydrate (CH2O) and to oxidize the unknown acceptor to A. This putative reaction can be represented as: Van Niel’s proposal was important because the popular (but incorrect) theory had been that oxygen was removed from carbon dioxide (rather than hydrogen from water, releasing oxygen) and that carbon then combined with water to form carbohydrate (rather than the hydrogen from water combining with CO2 to form CH2O). By 1940 chemists were using heavy isotopes to follow the reactions of photosynthesis. Water marked with an isotope of oxygen (18O) was used in early experiments. Plants that photosynthesized in the presence of water containing H218O produced oxygen gas containing 18O; those that photosynthesized in the presence of normal water produced normal oxygen gas. These results provided definitive support for van Niel’s theory that the oxygen gas produced during photosynthesis is derived from water.",

The only organisms able to exist under such conditions would be the chemosynthetic bacteria, which can utilize the chemical energy of certain inorganic compounds and thus are not dependent on the conversion of light energy.How are plant cells different from animal cells?All living things are composed of cells.(more)See all videos for this articleEnergy produced by photosynthesis carried out by plants millions of years ago is responsible for the fossil fuels (i.e., coal, oil, and gas) that power industrial society. In past ages, green plants and small organisms that fed on plants increased faster than they were consumed, and their remains were deposited in Earth’s crust by sedimentation and other geological processes. There, protected from oxidation, these organic remains were slowly converted to fossil fuels. These fuels not only provide much of the energy used in factories, homes, and transportation but also serve as the raw material for plastics and other synthetic products. Unfortunately, modern civilization is using up in a few centuries the excess of photosynthetic production accumulated over millions of years. Consequently, the carbon dioxide that has been removed from the air to make carbohydrates in photosynthesis over millions of years is being returned at an incredibly rapid rate. The carbon dioxide concentration in Earth’s atmosphere is rising the fastest it ever has in Earth’s history, and this phenomenon is expected to have major implications on Earth’s climate.Requirements for food, materials, and energy in a world where human population is rapidly growing have created a need to increase both the amount of photosynthesis and the efficiency of converting photosynthetic output into products useful to people. One response to those needs—the so-called Green Revolution, begun in the mid-20th century—achieved enormous improvements in agricultural yield through the use of chemical fertilizers, pest and plant-disease control, plant breeding, and mechanized tilling, harvesting, and crop processing. This effort limited severe famines to a few areas of the world despite rapid population growth, but it did not eliminate widespread malnutrition. Moreover, beginning in the early 1990s, the rate at which yields of major crops increased began to decline. This was especially true for rice in Asia. Rising costs associated with sustaining high rates of agricultural production, which required ever-increasing inputs of fertilizers and pesticides and constant development of new plant varieties, also became problematic for farmers in many countries.A second agricultural revolution, based on plant genetic engineering, was forecast to lead to increases in plant productivity and thereby partially alleviate malnutrition. Since the 1970s, molecular biologists have possessed the means to alter a plant’s genetic material (deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA) with the aim of achieving improvements in disease and drought resistance, product yield and quality, frost hardiness, and other desirable properties. However, such traits are inherently complex, and the process of making changes to crop plants through genetic engineering has turned out to be more complicated than anticipated. In the future such genetic engineering may result in improvements in the process of photosynthesis, but by the first decades of the 21st century, it had yet to demonstrate that it could dramatically increase crop yields.

When enough chloroplasts are assimilated, the slug may forgo the ingestion of food.

Priestley had burned a candle in a closed container until the air within the container could no longer support combustion. He then placed a sprig of mint plant in the container and discovered that after several days the mint had produced some substance (later recognized as oxygen) that enabled the confined air to again support combustion. In 1779 the Dutch physician Jan Ingenhousz expanded upon Priestley’s work, showing that the plant had to be exposed to light if the combustible substance (i.e., oxygen) was to be restored.

Subscribe In 1782 it was demonstrated that the combustion-supporting gas (oxygen) was formed at the expense of another gas, or “fixed air,” which had been identified the year before as carbon dioxide. Gas-exchange experiments in 1804 showed that the gain in weight of a plant grown in a carefully weighed pot resulted from the uptake of carbon, which came entirely from absorbed carbon dioxide, and water taken up by plant roots; the balance is oxygen, released back to the atmosphere. Almost half a century passed before the concept of chemical energy had developed sufficiently to permit the discovery (in 1845) that light energy from the sun is stored as chemical energy in products formed during photosynthesis. Overall reaction of photosynthesis In chemical terms, photosynthesis is a light-energized oxidation–reduction process. (Oxidation refers to the removal of electrons from a molecule; reduction refers to the gain of electrons by a molecule.) In plant photosynthesis, the energy of light is used to drive the oxidation of water (H2O), producing oxygen gas (O2), hydrogen ions (H+), and electrons. Most of the removed electrons and hydrogen ions ultimately are transferred to carbon dioxide (CO2), which is reduced to organic products. Other electrons and hydrogen ions are used to reduce nitrate and sulfate to amino and sulfhydryl groups in amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. In most green cells, carbohydrates—especially starch and the sugar sucrose—are the major direct organic products of photosynthesis. The overall reaction in which carbohydrates—represented by the general formula (CH2O)—are formed during plant photosynthesis can be indicated by the following equation: This equation is merely a summary statement, for the process of photosynthesis actually involves numerous reactions catalyzed by enzymes (organic catalysts). These reactions occur in two stages: the “light” stage, consisting of photochemical (i.e., light-capturing) reactions; and the “dark” stage, comprising chemical reactions controlled by enzymes. During the first stage, the energy of light is absorbed and used to drive a series of electron transfers, resulting in the synthesis of ATP and the electron-donor-reduced nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). During the dark stage, the ATP and NADPH formed in the light-capturing reactions are used to reduce carbon dioxide to organic carbon compounds. This assimilation of inorganic carbon into organic compounds is called carbon fixation. During the 20th century, comparisons between photosynthetic processes in green plants and in certain photosynthetic sulfur bacteria provided important information about the photosynthetic mechanism. Sulfur bacteria use hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a source of hydrogen atoms and produce sulfur instead of oxygen during photosynthesis. The overall reaction is In the 1930s Dutch biologist Cornelis van Niel recognized that the utilization of carbon dioxide to form organic compounds was similar in the two types of photosynthetic organisms. Suggesting that differences existed in the light-dependent stage and in the nature of the compounds used as a source of hydrogen atoms, he proposed that hydrogen was transferred from hydrogen sulfide (in bacteria) or water (in green plants) to an unknown acceptor (called A), which was reduced to H2A. During the dark reactions, which are similar in both bacteria and green plants, the reduced acceptor (H2A) reacted with carbon dioxide (CO2) to form carbohydrate (CH2O) and to oxidize the unknown acceptor to A. This putative reaction can be represented as: Van Niel’s proposal was important because the popular (but incorrect) theory had been that oxygen was removed from carbon dioxide (rather than hydrogen from water, releasing oxygen) and that carbon then combined with water to form carbohydrate (rather than the hydrogen from water combining with CO2 to form CH2O). By 1940 chemists were using heavy isotopes to follow the reactions of photosynthesis. Water marked with an isotope of oxygen (18O) was used in early experiments. Plants that photosynthesized in the presence of water containing H218O produced oxygen gas containing 18O; those that photosynthesized in the presence of normal water produced normal oxygen gas. These results provided definitive support for van Niel’s theory that the oxygen gas produced during photosynthesis is derived from water.",

It is the way in which virtually all energy in the biosphere becomes available to living things. As primary producers, photosynthetic organisms form the base of Earth’s food webs and are consumed directly or indirectly by all higher life-forms. Additionally, almost all the oxygen in the atmosphere is due to the process of photosynthesis. If photosynthesis ceased, there would soon be little food or other organic matter on Earth, most organisms would disappear, and Earth’s atmosphere would eventually become nearly devoid of gaseous oxygen. What is the basic formula for photosynthesis?The process of photosynthesis is commonly written as: 6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6 + 6O2. This means that the reactants, six carbon dioxide molecules and six water molecules, are converted by light energy captured by chlorophyll (implied by the arrow) into a sugar molecule and six oxygen molecules, the products. The sugar is used by the organism, and the oxygen is released as a by-product. Which organisms can photosynthesize?The ability to photosynthesize is found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. The most well-known examples are plants, as all but a very few parasitic or mycoheterotrophic species contain chlorophyll and produce their own food. Algae are the other dominant group of eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms. All algae, which include massive kelps and microscopic diatoms, are important primary producers. Cyanobacteria and certain sulfur bacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes, in whom photosynthesis evolved. No animals are thought to be independently capable of photosynthesis, though the emerald green sea slug can temporarily incorporate algae chloroplasts in its body for food production.

The carbohydrates produced are stored in or used by the plant. Composite image showing the global distribution of photosynthesis, including both oceanic phytoplankton and terrestrial vegetation. Dark red and blue-green indicate regions of high photosynthetic activity in the ocean and on land, respectively. Photosynthesis (/ˌfoʊtəˈsɪnθəsɪs/ FOH-tə-SINTH-ə-sis)[1] is a system of biological processes by which photosynthetic organisms, such as most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, convert light energy, typically from sunlight, into the chemical energy necessary to fuel their metabolism. Photosynthesis usually refers to oxygenic photosynthesis, a process that produces oxygen. Photosynthetic organisms store the chemical energy so produced within intracellular organic compounds (compounds containing carbon) like sugars, glycogen, cellulose and starches. To use this stored chemical energy, an organism's cells metabolize the organic compounds through cellular respiration. Photosynthesis plays a critical role in producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and it supplies most of the biological energy necessary for complex life on Earth.[2] Some bacteria also perform anoxygenic photosynthesis, which uses bacteriochlorophyll to split hydrogen sulfide as a reductant instead of water, producing sulfur instead of oxygen. Archaea such as Halobacterium also perform a type of non-carbon-fixing anoxygenic photosynthesis, where the simpler photopigment retinal and its microbial rhodopsin derivatives are used to absorb green light and power proton pumps to directly synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the \"energy currency\" of cells. Such archaeal photosynthesis might have been the earliest form of photosynthesis that evolved on Earth, as far back as the Paleoarchean, preceding that of cyanobacteria (see Purple Earth hypothesis). While the details may differ between species, the process always begins when light energy is absorbed by the reaction centers, proteins that contain photosynthetic pigments or chromophores. In plants, these pigments are chlorophylls (a porphyrin derivative that absorbs the red and blue spectrums of light, thus reflecting green) held inside chloroplasts, abundant in leaf cells. In bacteria, they are embedded in the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two important molecules that participate in energetic processes: reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and ATP. In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, sugars are synthesized by a subsequent sequence of light-independent reactions called the Calvin cycle. In this process, atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated into already existing organic compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP).[3] Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as glucose. In other bacteria, different mechanisms like the reverse Krebs cycle are used to achieve the same end. The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life using reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide, rather than water, as sources of electrons.[4] Cyanobacteria appeared later; the excess oxygen they produced contributed directly to the oxygenation of the Earth,[5] which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. The average rate of energy captured by global photosynthesis is approximately 130 terawatts,[6][7][8] which is about eight times the total power consumption of human civilization.[9] Photosynthetic organisms also convert around 100–115 billion tons (91–104 Pg petagrams, or billions of metric tons), of carbon into biomass per year.[10][11] Photosynthesis was discovered in 1779 by Jan Ingenhousz who showed that plants need light, not just soil and water. Overview Main article: Biological carbon fixation Photosynthesis changes sunlight into chemical energy, splits water to liberate O2, and fixes CO2 into sugar. Most photosynthetic organisms are photoautotrophs, which means that they are able to synthesize food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from light. However, not all organisms use carbon dioxide as a source of carbon atoms to carry out photosynthesis; photoheterotrophs use organic compounds, rather than carbon dioxide, as a source of carbon.[2] In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen. This oxygenic photosynthesis is by far the most common type of photosynthesis used by living organisms. Some shade-loving plants (sciophytes) produce such low levels of oxygen during photosynthesis that they use all of it themselves instead of releasing it to the atmosphere.[12] Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, the overall process is quite similar in these organisms. There are also many varieties of anoxygenic photosynthesis, used mostly by bacteria, which consume carbon dioxide but do not release oxygen or which produce elemental sulfur instead of molecular oxygen.[13][14] Carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called carbon fixation; photosynthesis captures energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates. Carbon fixation is an endothermic redox reaction. In general outline, photosynthesis is the opposite of cellular respiration: while photosynthesis is a process of reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates, cellular respiration is the oxidation of carbohydrates or other nutrients to carbon dioxide. Nutrients used in cellular respiration include carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids. These nutrients are oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water, and to release chemical energy to drive the organism's metabolism. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are distinct processes, as they take place through different sequences of chemical reactions and in different cellular compartments (cellular respiration in mitochondria).[15][16] The general equation for photosynthesis as first proposed by Cornelis van Niel is:[17] CO2carbondioxide + 2H2Aelectron donor + photonslight energy → [CH2O]carbohydrate + 2Aoxidizedelectrondonor + H2Owater Since water is used as the electron donor in oxygenic photosynthesis, the equation for this process is: CO2carbondioxide + 2H2Owater + photonslight energy → [CH2O]carbohydrate + O2oxygen + H2Owater This equation emphasizes that water is both a reactant in the light-dependent reaction and a product of the light-independent reaction, but canceling n water molecules from each side gives the net equation: CO2carbondioxide + H2O water + photonslight energy → [CH2O]carbohydrate + O2 oxygen Other processes substitute other compounds (such as arsenite) for water in the electron-supply role; for example some microbes use sunlight to oxidize arsenite to arsenate:[18] The equation for this reaction is: CO2carbondioxide + (AsO3−3)arsenite + photonslight energy → (AsO3−4)arsenate + COcarbonmonoxide(used to build other compounds in subsequent reactions)[19] Photosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, light-dependent reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the hydrogen carrier NADPH and the energy-storage molecule ATP. During the second stage, the light-independent reactions use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide. Most organisms that use oxygenic photosynthesis use visible light for the light-dependent reactions, although at least three use shortwave infrared or, more specifically, far-red radiation.[20] Some organisms employ even more radical variants of photosynthesis. Some archaea use a simpler method that employs a pigment similar to those used for vision in animals. The bacteriorhodopsin changes its configuration in response to sunlight, acting as a proton pump. This produces a proton gradient more directly, which is then converted to chemical energy. The process does not involve carbon dioxide fixation and does not release oxygen, and seems to have evolved separately from the more common types of photosynthesis.[21] Photosynthetic membranes and organelles Main articles: Chloroplast and Thylakoid Chloroplast ultrastructure:outer membraneintermembrane spaceinner membrane (1+2+3: envelope)stroma (aqueous fluid)thylakoid lumen (inside of thylakoid)thylakoid membranegranum (stack of thylakoids)thylakoid (lamella)starchribosomeplastidial DNAplastoglobule (drop of lipids) In photosynthetic bacteria, the proteins that gather light for photosynthesis are embedded in cell membranes. In its simplest form, this involves the membrane surrounding the cell itself.[22] However, the membrane may be tightly folded into cylindrical sheets called thylakoids,[23] or bunched up into round vesicles called intracytoplasmic membranes.[24] These structures can fill most of the interior of a cell, giving the membrane a very large surface area and therefore increasing the amount of light that the bacteria can absorb.[23] In plants and algae, photosynthesis takes place in organelles called chloroplasts. A typical plant cell contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts. The chloroplast is enclosed by a membrane. This membrane is composed of a phospholipid inner membrane, a phospholipid outer membrane, and an intermembrane space. Enclosed by the membrane is an aqueous fluid called the stroma. Embedded within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids (grana), which are the site of photosynthesis. The thylakoids appear as flattened disks. The thylakoid itself is enclosed by the thylakoid membrane, and within the enclosed volume is a lumen or thylakoid space. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane are integral and peripheral membrane protein complexes of the photosynthetic system. Plants absorb light primarily using the pigment chlorophyll. The green part of the light spectrum is not absorbed but is reflected, which is the reason that most plants have a green color. Besides chlorophyll, plants also use pigments such as carotenes and xanthophylls.[25] Algae also use chlorophyll, but various other pigments are present, such as phycocyanin, carotenes, and xanthophylls in green algae, phycoerythrin in red algae (rhodophytes) and fucoxanthin in brown algae and diatoms resulting in a wide variety of colors. These pigments are embedded in plants and algae in complexes called antenna proteins. In such proteins, the pigments are arranged to work together. Such a combination of proteins is also called a light-harvesting complex.[26] Although all cells in the green parts of a plant have chloroplasts, the majority of those are found in specially adapted structures called leaves. Certain species adapted to conditions of strong sunlight and aridity, such as many Euphorbia and cactus species, have their main photosynthetic organs in their stems. The cells in the interior tissues of a leaf, called the mesophyll, can contain between 450,000 and 800,000 chloroplasts for every square millimeter of leaf. The surface of the leaf is coated with a water-resistant waxy cuticle that protects the leaf from excessive evaporation of water and decreases the absorption of ultraviolet or blue light to minimize heating. The transparent epidermis layer allows light to pass through to the palisade mesophyll cells where most of the photosynthesis takes place. Light-dependent reactions Main article: Light-dependent reactions Light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis at the thylakoid membrane In the light-dependent reactions, one molecule of the pigment chlorophyll absorbs one photon and loses one electron. This electron is taken up by a modified form of chlorophyll called pheophytin, which passes the electron to a quinone molecule, starting the flow of electrons down an electron transport chain that leads to the ultimate reduction of NADP to NADPH. In addition, this creates a proton gradient (energy gradient) across the chloroplast membrane, which is used by ATP synthase in the synthesis of ATP. The chlorophyll molecule ultimately regains the electron it lost when a water molecule is split in a process called photolysis, which releases oxygen. The overall equation for the light-dependent reactions under the conditions of non-cyclic electron flow in green plants is:[27] 2 H2O + 2 NADP+ + 3 ADP + 3 Pi + light → 2 NADPH + 2 H+ + 3 ATP + O2 Not all wavelengths of light can support photosynthesis. The photosynthetic action spectrum depends on the type of accessory pigments present. For example, in green plants, the action spectrum resembles the absorption spectrum for chlorophylls and carotenoids with absorption peaks in violet-blue and red light. In red algae, the action spectrum is blue-green light, which allows these algae to use the blue end of the spectrum to grow in the deeper waters that filter out the longer wavelengths (red light) used by above-ground green plants. The non-absorbed part of the light spectrum is what gives photosynthetic organisms their color (e.g., green plants, red algae, purple bacteria) and is the least effective for photosynthesis in the respective organisms. Z scheme The \"Z scheme\" In plants, light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts where they drive the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. The light-dependent reactions are of two forms: cyclic and non-cyclic. In the non-cyclic reaction, the photons are captured in the light-harvesting antenna complexes of photosystem II by chlorophyll and other accessory pigments (see diagram \"Z-scheme\"). The absorption of a photon by the antenna complex loosens an electron by a process called photoinduced charge separation. The antenna system is at the core of the chlorophyll molecule of the photosystem II reaction center. That loosened electron is taken up by the primary electron-acceptor molecule, pheophytin. As the electrons are shuttled through an electron transport chain (the so-called Z-scheme shown in the diagram), a chemiosmotic potential is generated by pumping proton cations (H+) across the membrane and into the thylakoid space. An ATP synthase enzyme uses that chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during photophosphorylation, whereas NADPH is a product of the terminal redox reaction in the Z-scheme. The electron enters a chlorophyll molecule in Photosystem I. There it is further excited by the light absorbed by that photosystem. The electron is then passed along a chain of electron acceptors to which it transfers some of its energy. The energy delivered to the electron acceptors is used to move hydrogen ions across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. The electron is eventually used to reduce the coenzyme NADP with an H+ to NADPH (which has functions in the light-independent reaction); at that point, the path of that electron ends. The cyclic reaction is similar to that of the non-cyclic but differs in that it generates only ATP, and no reduced NADP (NADPH) is created. The cyclic reaction takes place only at photosystem I. Once the electron is displaced from the photosystem, the electron is passed down the electron acceptor molecules and returns to photosystem I, from where it was emitted, hence the name cyclic reaction. Water photolysis Main articles: Photodissociation and Oxygen evolution Linear electron transport through a photosystem will leave the reaction center of that photosystem oxidized. Elevating another electron will first require re-reduction of the reaction center. The excited electrons lost from the reaction center (P700) of photosystem I are replaced by transfer from plastocyanin, whose electrons come from electron transport through photosystem II. Photosystem II, as the first step of the Z-scheme, requires an external source of electrons to reduce its oxidized chlorophyll a reaction center. The source of electrons for photosynthesis in green plants and cyanobacteria is water. Two water molecules are oxidized by the energy of four successive charge-separation reactions of photosystem II to yield a molecule of diatomic oxygen and four hydrogen ions. The electrons yielded are transferred to a redox-active tyrosine residue that is oxidized by the energy of P680+. This resets the ability of P680 to absorb another photon and release another photo-dissociated electron. The oxidation of water is catalyzed in photosystem II by a redox-active structure that contains four manganese ions and a calcium ion; this oxygen-evolving complex binds two water molecules and contains the four oxidizing equivalents that are used to drive the water-oxidizing reaction (Kok's S-state diagrams). The hydrogen ions are released in the thylakoid lumen and therefore contribute to the transmembrane chemiosmotic potential that leads to ATP synthesis. Oxygen is a waste product of light-dependent reactions, but the majority of organisms on Earth use oxygen and its energy for cellular respiration, including photosynthetic organisms.[28][29] Light-independent reactions Calvin cycle Main articles: Calvin cycle and Carbon fixation In the light-independent (or \"dark\") reactions, the enzyme RuBisCO captures CO2 from the atmosphere and, in a process called the Calvin cycle, uses the newly formed NADPH and releases three-carbon sugars, which are later combined to form sucrose and starch. The overall equation for the light-independent reactions in green plants is[27]: 128 3 CO2 + 9 ATP + 6 NADPH + 6 H+ → C3H6O3-phosphate + 9 ADP + 8 Pi + 6 NADP+ + 3 H2O Overview of the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation Carbon fixation produces the three-carbon sugar intermediate, which is then converted into the final carbohydrate products. The simple carbon sugars photosynthesis produces are then used to form other organic compounds, such as the building material cellulose, the precursors for lipid and amino acid biosynthesis, or as a fuel in cellular respiration. The latter occurs not only in plants but also in animals when the carbon and energy from plants is passed through a food chain. The fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a process in which carbon dioxide combines with a five-carbon sugar, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, to yield two molecules of a three-carbon compound, glycerate 3-phosphate, also known as 3-phosphoglycerate. Glycerate 3-phosphate, in the presence of ATP and NADPH produced during the light-dependent stages, is reduced to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. This product is also referred to as 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) or, more generically, as triose phosphate. Most (five out of six molecules) of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced are used to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate so the process can continue. The triose phosphates not thus \"recycled\" often condense to form hexose phosphates, which ultimately yield sucrose, starch, and cellulose, as well as glucose and fructose. The sugars produced during carbon metabolism yield carbon skeletons that can be used for other metabolic reactions like the production of amino acids and lipids. Carbon concentrating mechanisms On land Main articles: C4 carbon fixation, CAM photosynthesis, and Alarm photosynthesis Overview of C4 carbon fixation. (This image mistakenly shows lactic acid instead of pyruvate, and all the species ending in \"-ate\" are shown as unionized acids, such as malic acid and so on). In hot and dry conditions, plants close their stomata to prevent water loss. Under these conditions, CO2 will decrease and oxygen gas, produced by the light reactions of photosynthesis, will increase, causing an increase of photorespiration by the oxygenase activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and decrease in carbon fixation. Some plants have evolved mechanisms to increase the CO2 concentration in the leaves under these conditions.[30] Plants that use the C4 carbon fixation process chemically fix carbon dioxide in the cells of the mesophyll by adding it to the three-carbon molecule phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called PEP carboxylase, creating the four-carbon organic acid oxaloacetic acid. Oxaloacetic acid or malate synthesized by this process is then translocated to specialized bundle sheath cells where the enzyme RuBisCO and other Calvin cycle enzymes are located, and where CO2 released by decarboxylation of the four-carbon acids is then fixed by RuBisCO activity to the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids. The physical separation of RuBisCO from the oxygen-generating light reactions reduces photorespiration and increases CO2 fixation and, thus, the photosynthetic capacity of the leaf.[31] C4 plants can produce more sugar than C3 plants in conditions of high light and temperature. Many important crop plants are C4 plants, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and millet. Plants that do not use PEP-carboxylase in carbon fixation are called C3 plants because the primary carboxylation reaction, catalyzed by RuBisCO, produces the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids directly in the Calvin-Benson cycle. Over 90% of plants use C3 carbon fixation, compared to 3% that use C4 carbon fixation;[32] however, the evolution of C4 in over sixty plant lineages makes it a striking example of convergent evolution.[30] C2 photosynthesis, which involves carbon-concentration by selective breakdown of photorespiratory glycine, is both an evolutionary precursor to C4 and a useful carbon-concentrating mechanism in its own right.[33] Xerophytes, such as cacti and most succulents, also use PEP carboxylase to capture carbon dioxide in a process called Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). In contrast to C4 metabolism, which spatially separates the CO2 fixation to PEP from the Calvin cycle, CAM temporally separates these two processes. CAM plants have a different leaf anatomy from C3 plants, and fix the CO2 at night, when their stomata are open. CAM plants store the CO2 mostly in the form of malic acid via carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate, which is then reduced to malate. Decarboxylation of malate during the day releases CO2 inside the leaves, thus allowing carbon fixation to 3-phosphoglycerate by RuBisCO. CAM is used by 16,000 species of plants.[34] Calcium-oxalate-accumulating plants, such as Amaranthus hybridus and Colobanthus quitensis, show a variation of photosynthesis where calcium oxalate crystals function as dynamic carbon pools, supplying carbon dioxide (CO2) to photosynthetic cells when stomata are partially or totally closed. This process was named alarm photosynthesis. Under stress conditions (e.g., water deficit), oxalate released from calcium oxalate crystals is converted to CO2 by an oxalate oxidase enzyme, and the produced CO2 can support the Calvin cycle reactions. Reactive hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the byproduct of oxalate oxidase reaction, can be neutralized by catalase. Alarm photosynthesis represents a photosynthetic variant to be added to the well-known C4 and CAM pathways. However, alarm photosynthesis, in contrast to these pathways, operates as a biochemical pump that collects carbon from the organ interior (or from the soil) and not from the atmosphere.[35][36] In water Cyanobacteria possess carboxysomes, which increase the concentration of CO2 around RuBisCO to increase the rate of photosynthesis. An enzyme, carbonic anhydrase, located within the carboxysome, releases CO2 from dissolved hydrocarbonate ions (HCO−3). Before the CO2 can diffuse out, RuBisCO concentrated within the carboxysome quickly sponges it up. HCO−3 ions are made from CO2 outside the cell by another carbonic anhydrase and are actively pumped into the cell by a membrane protein. They cannot cross the membrane as they are charged, and within the cytosol they turn back into CO2 very slowly without the help of carbonic anhydrase. This causes the HCO−3 ions to accumulate within the cell from where they diffuse into the carboxysomes.[37] Pyrenoids in algae and hornworts also act to concentrate CO2 around RuBisCO.[38][39] Order and kinetics The overall process of photosynthesis takes place in four stages:[11] Stage Event Site Time scale 1 Energy transfer in antenna chlorophyll Thylakoid membranes in the chloroplasts Femtosecond to picosecond 2 Transfer of electrons in photochemical reactions Picosecond to nanosecond 3 Electron transport chain and ATP synthesis Microsecond to millisecond 4 Carbon fixation and export of stable products Stroma of the chloroplasts and the cell cytosol Millisecond to second Efficiency Main article: Photosynthetic efficiency Plants usually convert light into chemical energy with a photosynthetic efficiency of 3–6%.[40][41] Absorbed light that is unconverted is dissipated primarily as heat, with a small fraction (1–2%) reemitted as chlorophyll fluorescence at longer (redder) wavelengths. This fact allows measurement of the light reaction of photosynthesis by using chlorophyll fluorometers.[42] Actual plants' photosynthetic efficiency varies with the frequency of the light being converted, light intensity, temperature, and proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and can vary from 0.1% to 8%.[43] By comparison, solar panels convert light into electric energy at an efficiency of approximately 6–20% for mass-produced panels, and above 40% in laboratory devices. Scientists are studying photosynthesis in hopes of developing plants with increased yield.[41] The efficiency of both light and dark reactions can be measured, but the relationship between the two can be complex. For example, the light reaction creates ATP and NADPH energy molecules, which C3 plants can use for carbon fixation or photorespiration.[44] Electrons may also flow to other electron sinks.[45][46][47] For this reason, it is not uncommon for authors to differentiate between work done under non-photorespiratory conditions and under photorespiratory conditions.[48][49][50] Chlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II can measure the light reaction, and infrared gas analyzers can measure the dark reaction.[51] An integrated chlorophyll fluorometer and gas exchange system can investigate both light and dark reactions when researchers use the two separate systems together.[52] Infrared gas analyzers and some moisture sensors are sensitive enough to measure the photosynthetic assimilation of CO2 and of ΔH2O using reliable methods. CO2 is commonly measured in μmols/(m2/s), parts per million, or volume per million; and H2O is commonly measured in mmols/(m2/s) or in mbars. By measuring CO2 assimilation, ΔH2O, leaf temperature, barometric pressure, leaf area, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), it becomes possible to estimate, \"A\" or carbon assimilation, \"E\" or transpiration, \"gs\" or stomatal conductance, and \"Ci\" or intracellular CO2.[53] However, it is more common to use chlorophyll fluorescence for plant stress measurement, where appropriate, because the most commonly used parameters FV/FM and Y(II) or F/FM' can be measured in a few seconds, allowing the investigation of larger plant populations.[50] Gas exchange systems that offer control of CO2 levels, above and below ambient, allow the common practice of measurement of A/Ci curves, at different CO2 levels, to characterize a plant's photosynthetic response.[53] Integrated chlorophyll fluorometer – gas exchange systems allow a more precise measure of photosynthetic response and mechanisms.[51][52] While standard gas exchange photosynthesis systems can measure Ci, or substomatal CO2 levels, the addition of integrated chlorophyll fluorescence measurements allows a more precise measurement of CC, the estimation of CO2 concentration at the site of carboxylation in the chloroplast, to replace Ci.[52][54] CO2 concentration in the chloroplast becomes possible to estimate with the measurement of mesophyll conductance or gm using an integrated system.[51][52][55] Photosynthesis measurement systems are not designed to directly measure the amount of light the leaf absorbs, but analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence, P700- and P515-absorbance, and gas exchange measurements reveal detailed information about, e.g., the photosystems, quantum efficiency and the CO2 assimilation rates. With some instruments, even wavelength dependency of the photosynthetic efficiency can be analyzed.[56] A phenomenon known as quantum walk increases the efficiency of the energy transport of light significantly. In the photosynthetic cell of an alga, bacterium, or plant, there are light-sensitive molecules called chromophores arranged in an antenna-shaped structure called a photocomplex. When a photon is absorbed by a chromophore, it is converted into a quasiparticle referred to as an exciton, which jumps from chromophore to chromophore towards the reaction center of the photocomplex, a collection of molecules that traps its energy in a chemical form accessible to the cell's metabolism. The exciton's wave properties enable it to cover a wider area and try out several possible paths simultaneously, allowing it to instantaneously \"choose\" the most efficient route, where it will have the highest probability of arriving at its destination in the minimum possible time. Because that quantum walking takes place at temperatures far higher than quantum phenomena usually occur, it is only possible over very short distances. Obstacles in the form of destructive interference cause the particle to lose its wave properties for an instant before it regains them once again after it is freed from its locked position through a classic \"hop\". The movement of the electron towards the photo center is therefore covered in a series of conventional hops and quantum walks.[57][58][59] Evolution Main article: Evolution of photosynthesis Life timelineThis box: viewtalkedit−4500 —–—–−4000 —–—–−3500 —–—–−3000 —–—–−2500 —–—–−2000 —–—–−1500 —–—–−1000 —–—–−500 —–—–0 — Water Single-celled life Photosynthesis Multicellular life Plants Arthropods MolluscsFlowersDinosaurs MammalsBirdsPrimatesHadeanArcheanProterozoicPhanerozoic ←Earth formed←Earliest water←LUCA←Earliest fossils←Atmospheric oxygen←Sexual reproduction←Earliest fungi←Greening of Earth←Ediacaran biota←Cambrian explosion←Earliest tetrapods←Earliest hominoid(million years ago) Fossils of what are thought to be filamentous photosynthetic organisms have been dated at 3.4 billion years old.[60][61] More recent studies also suggest that photosynthesis may have begun about 3.4 billion years ago,[62][63] though the first direct evidence of photosynthesis comes from thylakoid membranes preserved in 1.75-billion-year-old cherts.[64] Oxygenic photosynthesis is the main source of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere, and its earliest appearance is sometimes referred to as the oxygen catastrophe. Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, such as that in cyanobacteria, became important during the Paleoproterozoic era around two billion years ago. Modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic, using water as an electron donor, which is oxidized to molecular oxygen in the photosynthetic reaction center. Symbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts Plant cells with visible chloroplasts (from a moss, Plagiomnium affine) Several groups of animals have formed symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic algae. These are most common in corals, sponges, and sea anemones. Scientists presume that this is due to the particularly simple body plans and large surface areas of these animals compared to their volumes.[65] In addition, a few marine mollusks, such as Elysia viridis and Elysia chlorotica, also maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae in their diet and then store in their bodies (see Kleptoplasty). This allows the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time.[66][67] Some of the genes from the plant cell nucleus have even been transferred to the slugs, so that the chloroplasts can be supplied with proteins they need to survive.[68] An even closer form of symbiosis may explain the origin of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have many similarities with photosynthetic bacteria, including a circular chromosome, prokaryotic-type ribosome, and similar proteins in the photosynthetic reaction center.[69][70] The endosymbiotic theory suggests that photosynthetic bacteria were acquired (by endocytosis) by early eukaryotic cells to form the first plant cells. Therefore, chloroplasts may be photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts possess their own DNA, separate from the nuclear DNA of their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast DNA resemble those found in cyanobacteria.[71] DNA in chloroplasts codes for redox proteins such as those found in the photosynthetic reaction centers. The CoRR Hypothesis proposes that this co-location of genes with their gene products is required for redox regulation of gene expression, and accounts for the persistence of DNA in bioenergetic organelles.[72] Photosynthetic eukaryotic lineages Symbiotic and kleptoplastic organisms excluded: The glaucophytes and the red and green algae—clade Archaeplastida (uni- and multicellular) The cryptophytes—clade Cryptista (unicellular) The haptophytes—clade Haptista (unicellular) The dinoflagellates and chromerids in the superphylum Myzozoa, and Pseudoblepharisma in the phylum Ciliophora—clade Alveolata (unicellular) The ochrophytes—clade Stramenopila (uni- and multicellular) The chlorarachniophytes and three species of Paulinella in the phylum Cercozoa—clade Rhizaria (unicellular) The euglenids—clade Excavata (unicellular) Except for the euglenids, which are found within the Excavata, all of these belong to the Diaphoretickes. Archaeplastida and the photosynthetic Paulinella got their plastids, which are surrounded by two membranes, through primary endosymbiosis in two separate events, by engulfing a cyanobacterium. The plastids in all the other groups have either a red or green algal origin, and are referred to as the \"red lineages\" and the \"green lineages\". The only known exception is the ciliate Pseudoblepharisma tenue, which in addition to its plastids that originated from green algae also has a purple sulfur bacterium as symbiont. In dinoflagellates and euglenids the plastids are surrounded by three membranes, and in the remaining lines by four. A nucleomorph, remnants of the original algal nucleus located between the inner and outer membranes of the plastid, is present in the cryptophytes (from a red alga) and chlorarachniophytes (from a green alga).[73] Some dinoflagellates that lost their photosynthetic ability later regained it again through new endosymbiotic events with different algae. While able to perform photosynthesis, many of these eukaryotic groups are mixotrophs and practice heterotrophy to various degrees. Photosynthetic prokaryotic lineages Early photosynthetic systems, such as those in green and purple sulfur and green and purple nonsulfur bacteria, are thought to have been anoxygenic, and used various other molecules than water as electron donors. Green and purple sulfur bacteria are thought to have used hydrogen and sulfur as electron donors. Green nonsulfur bacteria used various amino and other organic acids as electron donors. Purple nonsulfur bacteria used a variety of nonspecific organic molecules. The use of these molecules is consistent with the geological evidence that Earth's early atmosphere was highly reducing at that time.[74] With a possible exception of Heimdallarchaeota, photosynthesis is not found in archaea.[75] Haloarchaea are photoheterotrophic; they can absorb energy from the sun, but do not harvest carbon from the atmosphere and are therefore not photosynthetic.[76] Instead of chlorophyll they use rhodopsins, which convert light-energy to ion gradients but cannot mediate electron transfer reactions.[77][78] In bacteria eight photosynthetic lineages are currently known:[79][80][81][82] Cyanobacteria, the only prokaryotes performing oxygenic photosynthesis and the only prokaryotes that contain two types of photosystems (type I (RCI), also known as Fe-S type, and type II (RCII), also known as quinone type). The seven remaining prokaryotes have anoxygenic photosynthesis and use versions of either type I or type II. Chlorobi (green sulfur bacteria) Type I Heliobacteria Type I Chloracidobacterium Type I Proteobacteria (purple sulfur bacteria and purple non-sulfur bacteria) Type II (see: Purple bacteria) Chloroflexota (green non-sulfur bacteria) Type II Gemmatimonadota Type II Eremiobacterota Type II Cyanobacteria and the evolution of photosynthesis The biochemical capacity to use water as the source for electrons in photosynthesis evolved once, in a common ancestor of extant cyanobacteria (formerly called blue-green algae). The geological record indicates that this transforming event took place early in Earth's history, at least 2450–2320 million years ago (Ma), and, it is speculated, much earlier.[83][84] Because the Earth's atmosphere contained almost no oxygen during the estimated development of photosynthesis, it is believed that the first photosynthetic cyanobacteria did not generate oxygen.[85] Available evidence from geobiological studies of Archean (>2500 Ma) sedimentary rocks indicates that life existed 3500 Ma, but the question of when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved is still unanswered. A clear paleontological window on cyanobacterial evolution opened about 2000 Ma, revealing an already-diverse biota of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria remained the principal primary producers of oxygen throughout the Proterozoic Eon (2500–543 Ma), in part because the redox structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of nitrogen fixation.[86][87] Green algae joined cyanobacteria as the major primary producers of oxygen on continental shelves near the end of the Proterozoic, but only with the Mesozoic (251–66 Ma) radiations of dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids, and diatoms did the primary production of oxygen in marine shelf waters take modern form. Cyanobacteria remain critical to marine ecosystems as primary producers of oxygen in oceanic gyres, as agents of biological nitrogen fixation, and, in modified form, as the plastids of marine algae.[88] Experimental history Discovery Although some of the steps in photosynthesis are still not completely understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 19th century. Portrait of Jan Baptist van Helmont by Mary Beale, c. 1674 Jan van Helmont began the research of the process in the mid-17th century when he carefully measured the mass of the soil a plant was using and the mass of the plant as it grew. After noticing that the soil mass changed very little, he hypothesized that the mass of the growing plant must come from the water, the only substance he added to the potted plant. His hypothesis was partially accurate – much of the gained mass comes from carbon dioxide as well as water. However, this was a signaling point to the idea that the bulk of a plant's biomass comes from the inputs of photosynthesis, not the soil itself. Joseph Priestley, a chemist and minister, discovered that when he isolated a volume of air under an inverted jar and burned a candle in it (which gave off CO2), the candle would burn out very quickly, much before it ran out of wax. He further discovered that a mouse could similarly \"injure\" air. He then showed that a plant could restore the air the candle and the mouse had \"injured.\"[89] In 1779, Jan Ingenhousz repeated Priestley's experiments. He discovered that it was the influence of sunlight on the plant that could cause it to revive a mouse in a matter of hours.[89][90] In 1796, Jean Senebier, a Swiss pastor, botanist, and naturalist, demonstrated that green plants consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen under the influence of light. Soon afterward, Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure showed that the increase in mass of the plant as it grows could not be due only to uptake of CO2 but also to the incorporation of water. Thus, the basic reaction by which organisms use photosynthesis to produce food (such as glucose) was outlined.[91] Refinements Cornelis Van Niel made key discoveries explaining the chemistry of photosynthesis. By studying purple sulfur bacteria and green bacteria, he was the first to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a light-dependent redox reaction in which hydrogen reduces (donates its atoms as electrons and protons to) carbon dioxide. Robert Emerson discovered two light reactions by testing plant productivity using different wavelengths of light. With the red alone, the light reactions were suppressed. When blue and red were combined, the output was much more substantial. Thus, there were two photosystems, one absorbing up to 600 nm wavelengths, the other up to 700 nm. The former is known as PSII, the latter is PSI. PSI contains only chlorophyll \"a\", PSII contains primarily chlorophyll \"a\" with most of the available chlorophyll \"b\", among other pigments. These include phycobilins, which are the red and blue pigments of red and blue algae, respectively, and fucoxanthol for brown algae and diatoms. The process is most productive when the absorption of quanta is equal in both PSII and PSI, assuring that input energy from the antenna complex is divided between the PSI and PSII systems, which in turn powers the photochemistry.[11] Robert Hill thought that a complex of reactions consisted of an intermediate to cytochrome b6 (now a plastoquinone), and that another was from cytochrome f to a step in the carbohydrate-generating mechanisms. These are linked by plastoquinone, which does require energy to reduce cytochrome f. Further experiments to prove that the oxygen developed during the photosynthesis of green plants came from water were performed by Hill in 1937 and 1939. He showed that isolated chloroplasts give off oxygen in the presence of unnatural reducing agents like iron oxalate, ferricyanide or benzoquinone after exposure to light. In the Hill reaction:[92] 2 H2O + 2 A + (light, chloroplasts) → 2 AH2 + O2 A is the electron acceptor. Therefore, in light, the electron acceptor is reduced and oxygen is evolved. Samuel Ruben and Martin Kamen used radioactive isotopes to determine that the oxygen liberated in photosynthesis came from the water. Melvin Calvin works in his photosynthesis laboratory. Melvin Calvin and Andrew Benson, along with James Bassham, elucidated the path of carbon assimilation (the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle) in plants. The carbon reduction cycle is known as the Calvin cycle, but many scientists refer to it as the Calvin-Benson, Benson-Calvin, or even Calvin-Benson-Bassham (or CBB) Cycle. Nobel Prize–winning scientist Rudolph A. Marcus was later able to discover the function and significance of the electron transport chain. Otto Heinrich Warburg and Dean Burk discovered the I-quantum photosynthesis reaction that splits CO2, activated by the respiration.[93] In 1950, first experimental evidence for the existence of photophosphorylation in vivo was presented by Otto Kandler using intact Chlorella cells and interpreting his findings as light-dependent ATP formation.[94] In 1954, Daniel I. Arnon et al. discovered photophosphorylation in vitro in isolated chloroplasts with the help of P32.[95][96] Louis N. M. Duysens and Jan Amesz discovered that chlorophyll \"a\" will absorb one light, oxidize cytochrome f, while chlorophyll \"a\" (and other pigments) will absorb another light but will reduce this same oxidized cytochrome, stating the two light reactions are in series. Development of the concept In 1893, the American botanist Charles Reid Barnes proposed two terms, photosyntax and photosynthesis, for the biological process of synthesis of complex carbon compounds out of carbonic acid, in the presence of chlorophyll, under the influence of light. The term photosynthesis is derived from the Greek phōs (φῶς, gleam) and sýnthesis (σύνθεσις, arranging together),[97][98][99] while another word that he designated was photosyntax, from sýntaxis (σύνταξις, configuration). Over time, the term photosynthesis came into common usage. Later discovery of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria and photophosphorylation necessitated redefinition of the term.[100] C3 : C4 photosynthesis research In the late 1940s at the University of California, Berkeley, the details of photosynthetic carbon metabolism were sorted out by the chemists Melvin Calvin, Andrew Benson, James Bassham and a score of students and researchers utilizing the carbon-14 isotope and paper chromatography techniques.[101] The pathway of CO2 fixation by the algae Chlorella in a fraction of a second in light resulted in a three carbon molecule called phosphoglyceric acid (PGA). For that original and ground-breaking work, a Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Melvin Calvin in 1961. In parallel, plant physiologists studied leaf gas exchanges using the new method of infrared gas analysis and a leaf chamber where the net photosynthetic rates ranged from 10 to 13 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1, with the conclusion that all terrestrial plants have the same photosynthetic capacities, that are light saturated at less than 50% of sunlight.[102][103] Later in 1958–1963 at Cornell University, field grown maize was reported to have much greater leaf photosynthetic rates of 40 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1 and not be saturated at near full sunlight.[104][105] This higher rate in maize was almost double of those observed in other species such as wheat and soybean, indicating that large differences in photosynthesis exist among higher plants. At the University of Arizona, detailed gas exchange research on more than 15 species of monocots and dicots uncovered for the first time that differences in leaf anatomy are crucial factors in differentiating photosynthetic capacities among species.[106][107] In tropical grasses, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, Bermuda grass and in the dicot amaranthus, leaf photosynthetic rates were around 38−40 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1, and the leaves have two types of green cells, i.e. outer layer of mesophyll cells surrounding a tightly packed cholorophyllous vascular bundle sheath cells. This type of anatomy was termed Kranz anatomy in the 19th century by the botanist Gottlieb Haberlandt while studying leaf anatomy of sugarcane.[108] Plant species with the greatest photosynthetic rates and Kranz anatomy showed no apparent photorespiration, very low CO2 compensation point, high optimum temperature, high stomatal resistances and lower mesophyll resistances for gas diffusion and rates never saturated at full sun light.[109] The research at Arizona was designated a Citation Classic in 1986.[107] These species were later termed C4 plants as the first stable compound of CO2 fixation in light has four carbons as malate and aspartate.[110][111][112] Other species that lack Kranz anatomy were termed C3 type such as cotton and sunflower, as the first stable carbon compound is the three-carbon PGA. At 1000 ppm CO2 in measuring air, both the C3 and C4 plants had similar leaf photosynthetic rates around 60 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1 indicating the suppression of photorespiration in C3 plants.[106][107] Factors The leaf is the primary site of photosynthesis in plants. There are four main factors influencing photosynthesis and several corollary factors. The four main are:[113] Light irradiance and wavelength Water absorption Carbon dioxide concentration Temperature. Total photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors. These include the amount of light available, the amount of leaf area a plant has to capture light (shading by other plants is a major limitation of photosynthesis), the rate at which carbon dioxide can be supplied to the chloroplasts to support photosynthesis, the availability of water, and the availability of suitable temperatures for carrying out photosynthesis.[114] Light intensity (irradiance), wavelength and temperature See also: PI (photosynthesis-irradiance) curve Absorbance spectra of free chlorophyll a (blue) and b (red) in a solvent. The action spectra of chlorophyll molecules are slightly modified in vivo depending on specific pigment–protein interactions. The process of photosynthesis provides the main input of free energy into the biosphere, and is one of four main ways in which radiation is important for plant life.[115] The radiation climate within plant communities is extremely variable, in both time and space. In the early 20th century, Frederick Blackman and Gabrielle Matthaei investigated the effects of light intensity (irradiance) and temperature on the rate of carbon assimilation. At constant temperature, the rate of carbon assimilation varies with irradiance, increasing as the irradiance increases, but reaching a plateau at higher irradiance. At low irradiance, increasing the temperature has little influence on the rate of carbon assimilation. At constant high irradiance, the rate of carbon assimilation increases as the temperature is increased. These two experiments illustrate several important points: First, it is known that, in general, photochemical reactions are not affected by temperature. However, these experiments clearly show that temperature affects the rate of carbon assimilation, so there must be two sets of reactions in the full process of carbon assimilation. These are the light-dependent 'photochemical' temperature-independent stage, and the light-independent, temperature-dependent stage. Second, Blackman's experiments illustrate the concept of limiting factors. Another limiting factor is the wavelength of light. Cyanobacteria, which reside several meters underwater, cannot receive the correct wavelengths required to cause photoinduced charge separation in conventional photosynthetic pigments. To combat this problem, Cyanobacteria have a light-harvesting complex called Phycobilisome.[116] This complex is made up of a series of proteins with different pigments which surround the reaction center. Carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration Photorespiration As carbon dioxide concentrations rise, the rate at which sugars are made by the light-independent reactions increases until limited by other factors. RuBisCO, the enzyme that captures carbon dioxide in the light-independent reactions, has a binding affinity for both carbon dioxide and oxygen. When the concentration of carbon dioxide is high, RuBisCO will fix carbon dioxide. However, if the carbon dioxide concentration is low, RuBisCO will bind oxygen instead of carbon dioxide. This process, called photorespiration, uses energy, but does not produce sugars. RuBisCO oxygenase activity is disadvantageous to plants for several reasons: One product of oxygenase activity is phosphoglycolate (2 carbon) instead of 3-phosphoglycerate (3 carbon). Phosphoglycolate cannot be metabolized by the Calvin-Benson cycle and represents carbon lost from the cycle. A high oxygenase activity, therefore, drains the sugars that are required to recycle ribulose 5-bisphosphate and for the continuation of the Calvin-Benson cycle. Phosphoglycolate is quickly metabolized to glycolate that is toxic to a plant at a high concentration; it inhibits photosynthesis. Salvaging glycolate is an energetically expensive process that uses the glycolate pathway, and only 75% of the carbon is returned to the Calvin-Benson cycle as 3-phosphoglycerate. The reactions also produce ammonia (NH3), which is able to diffuse out of the plant, leading to a loss of nitrogen. A highly simplified summary is: 2 glycolate + ATP → 3-phosphoglycerate + carbon dioxide + ADP + NH3 The salvaging pathway for the products of RuBisCO oxygenase activity is more commonly known as photorespiration, since it is characterized by light-dependent oxygen consumption and the release of carbon dioxide.

  "Biological process to convert light into chemical energy Schematic of photosynthesis in plants. The carbohydrates produced are stored in or used by the plant. Composite image showing the global distribution of photosynthesis, including both oceanic phytoplankton and terrestrial vegetation. Dark red and blue-green indicate regions of high photosynthetic activity in the ocean and on land, respectively. Photosynthesis (/ˌfoʊtəˈsɪnθəsɪs/ FOH-tə-SINTH-ə-sis)[1] is a system of biological processes by which photosynthetic organisms, such as most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, convert light energy, typically from sunlight, into the chemical energy necessary to fuel their metabolism. Photosynthesis usually refers to oxygenic photosynthesis, a process that produces oxygen. Photosynthetic organisms store the chemical energy so produced within intracellular organic compounds (compounds containing carbon) like sugars, glycogen, cellulose and starches. To use this stored chemical energy, an organism's cells metabolize the organic compounds through cellular respiration. Photosynthesis plays a critical role in producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and it supplies most of the biological energy necessary for complex life on Earth.[2] Some bacteria also perform anoxygenic photosynthesis, which uses bacteriochlorophyll to split hydrogen sulfide as a reductant instead of water, producing sulfur instead of oxygen. Archaea such as Halobacterium also perform a type of non-carbon-fixing anoxygenic photosynthesis, where the simpler photopigment retinal and its microbial rhodopsin derivatives are used to absorb green light and power proton pumps to directly synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the \"energy currency\" of cells. Such archaeal photosynthesis might have been the earliest form of photosynthesis that evolved on Earth, as far back as the Paleoarchean, preceding that of cyanobacteria (see Purple Earth hypothesis). While the details may differ between species, the process always begins when light energy is absorbed by the reaction centers, proteins that contain photosynthetic pigments or chromophores. In plants, these pigments are chlorophylls (a porphyrin derivative that absorbs the red and blue spectrums of light, thus reflecting green) held inside chloroplasts, abundant in leaf cells. In bacteria, they are embedded in the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two important molecules that participate in energetic processes: reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and ATP. In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, sugars are synthesized by a subsequent sequence of light-independent reactions called the Calvin cycle. In this process, atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated into already existing organic compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP).[3] Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as glucose. In other bacteria, different mechanisms like the reverse Krebs cycle are used to achieve the same end. The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life using reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide, rather than water, as sources of electrons.[4] Cyanobacteria appeared later; the excess oxygen they produced contributed directly to the oxygenation of the Earth,[5] which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. The average rate of energy captured by global photosynthesis is approximately 130 terawatts,[6][7][8] which is about eight times the total power consumption of human civilization.[9] Photosynthetic organisms also convert around 100–115 billion tons (91–104 Pg petagrams, or billions of metric tons), of carbon into biomass per year.[10][11] Photosynthesis was discovered in 1779 by Jan Ingenhousz who showed that plants need light, not just soil and water. Overview Main article: Biological carbon fixation Photosynthesis changes sunlight into chemical energy, splits water to liberate O2, and fixes CO2 into sugar. Most photosynthetic organisms are photoautotrophs, which means that they are able to synthesize food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from light. However, not all organisms use carbon dioxide as a source of carbon atoms to carry out photosynthesis; photoheterotrophs use organic compounds, rather than carbon dioxide, as a source of carbon.[2] In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen. This oxygenic photosynthesis is by far the most common type of photosynthesis used by living organisms. Some shade-loving plants (sciophytes) produce such low levels of oxygen during photosynthesis that they use all of it themselves instead of releasing it to the atmosphere.[12] Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, the overall process is quite similar in these organisms. There are also many varieties of anoxygenic photosynthesis, used mostly by bacteria, which consume carbon dioxide but do not release oxygen or which produce elemental sulfur instead of molecular oxygen.[13][14] Carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called carbon fixation; photosynthesis captures energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates. Carbon fixation is an endothermic redox reaction. In general outline, photosynthesis is the opposite of cellular respiration: while photosynthesis is a process of reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates, cellular respiration is the oxidation of carbohydrates or other nutrients to carbon dioxide. Nutrients used in cellular respiration include carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids. These nutrients are oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water, and to release chemical energy to drive the organism's metabolism. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are distinct processes, as they take place through different sequences of chemical reactions and in different cellular compartments (cellular respiration in mitochondria).[15][16] The general equation for photosynthesis as first proposed by Cornelis van Niel is:[17] CO2carbondioxide + 2H2Aelectron donor + photonslight energy → [CH2O]carbohydrate + 2Aoxidizedelectrondonor + H2Owater Since water is used as the electron donor in oxygenic photosynthesis, the equation for this process is: CO2carbondioxide + 2H2Owater + photonslight energy → [CH2O]carbohydrate + O2oxygen + H2Owater This equation emphasizes that water is both a reactant in the light-dependent reaction and a product of the light-independent reaction, but canceling n water molecules from each side gives the net equation: CO2carbondioxide + H2O water + photonslight energy → [CH2O]carbohydrate + O2 oxygen Other processes substitute other compounds (such as arsenite) for water in the electron-supply role; for example some microbes use sunlight to oxidize arsenite to arsenate:[18] The equation for this reaction is: CO2carbondioxide + (AsO3−3)arsenite + photonslight energy → (AsO3−4)arsenate + COcarbonmonoxide(used to build other compounds in subsequent reactions)[19] Photosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, light-dependent reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the hydrogen carrier NADPH and the energy-storage molecule ATP. During the second stage, the light-independent reactions use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide. Most organisms that use oxygenic photosynthesis use visible light for the light-dependent reactions, although at least three use shortwave infrared or, more specifically, far-red radiation.[20] Some organisms employ even more radical variants of photosynthesis. Some archaea use a simpler method that employs a pigment similar to those used for vision in animals. The bacteriorhodopsin changes its configuration in response to sunlight, acting as a proton pump. This produces a proton gradient more directly, which is then converted to chemical energy. The process does not involve carbon dioxide fixation and does not release oxygen, and seems to have evolved separately from the more common types of photosynthesis.[21] Photosynthetic membranes and organelles Main articles: Chloroplast and Thylakoid Chloroplast ultrastructure:outer membraneintermembrane spaceinner membrane (1+2+3: envelope)stroma (aqueous fluid)thylakoid lumen (inside of thylakoid)thylakoid membranegranum (stack of thylakoids)thylakoid (lamella)starchribosomeplastidial DNAplastoglobule (drop of lipids) In photosynthetic bacteria, the proteins that gather light for photosynthesis are embedded in cell membranes. In its simplest form, this involves the membrane surrounding the cell itself.[22] However, the membrane may be tightly folded into cylindrical sheets called thylakoids,[23] or bunched up into round vesicles called intracytoplasmic membranes.[24] These structures can fill most of the interior of a cell, giving the membrane a very large surface area and therefore increasing the amount of light that the bacteria can absorb.[23] In plants and algae, photosynthesis takes place in organelles called chloroplasts. A typical plant cell contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts. The chloroplast is enclosed by a membrane. This membrane is composed of a phospholipid inner membrane, a phospholipid outer membrane, and an intermembrane space. Enclosed by the membrane is an aqueous fluid called the stroma. Embedded within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids (grana), which are the site of photosynthesis. The thylakoids appear as flattened disks. The thylakoid itself is enclosed by the thylakoid membrane, and within the enclosed volume is a lumen or thylakoid space. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane are integral and peripheral membrane protein complexes of the photosynthetic system. Plants absorb light primarily using the pigment chlorophyll. The green part of the light spectrum is not absorbed but is reflected, which is the reason that most plants have a green color. Besides chlorophyll, plants also use pigments such as carotenes and xanthophylls.[25] Algae also use chlorophyll, but various other pigments are present, such as phycocyanin, carotenes, and xanthophylls in green algae, phycoerythrin in red algae (rhodophytes) and fucoxanthin in brown algae and diatoms resulting in a wide variety of colors. These pigments are embedded in plants and algae in complexes called antenna proteins. In such proteins, the pigments are arranged to work together. Such a combination of proteins is also called a light-harvesting complex.[26] Although all cells in the green parts of a plant have chloroplasts, the majority of those are found in specially adapted structures called leaves. Certain species adapted to conditions of strong sunlight and aridity, such as many Euphorbia and cactus species, have their main photosynthetic organs in their stems. The cells in the interior tissues of a leaf, called the mesophyll, can contain between 450,000 and 800,000 chloroplasts for every square millimeter of leaf. The surface of the leaf is coated with a water-resistant waxy cuticle that protects the leaf from excessive evaporation of water and decreases the absorption of ultraviolet or blue light to minimize heating. The transparent epidermis layer allows light to pass through to the palisade mesophyll cells where most of the photosynthesis takes place. Light-dependent reactions Main article: Light-dependent reactions Light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis at the thylakoid membrane In the light-dependent reactions, one molecule of the pigment chlorophyll absorbs one photon and loses one electron. This electron is taken up by a modified form of chlorophyll called pheophytin, which passes the electron to a quinone molecule, starting the flow of electrons down an electron transport chain that leads to the ultimate reduction of NADP to NADPH. In addition, this creates a proton gradient (energy gradient) across the chloroplast membrane, which is used by ATP synthase in the synthesis of ATP. The chlorophyll molecule ultimately regains the electron it lost when a water molecule is split in a process called photolysis, which releases oxygen. The overall equation for the light-dependent reactions under the conditions of non-cyclic electron flow in green plants is:[27] 2 H2O + 2 NADP+ + 3 ADP + 3 Pi + light → 2 NADPH + 2 H+ + 3 ATP + O2 Not all wavelengths of light can support photosynthesis. The photosynthetic action spectrum depends on the type of accessory pigments present. For example, in green plants, the action spectrum resembles the absorption spectrum for chlorophylls and carotenoids with absorption peaks in violet-blue and red light. In red algae, the action spectrum is blue-green light, which allows these algae to use the blue end of the spectrum to grow in the deeper waters that filter out the longer wavelengths (red light) used by above-ground green plants. The non-absorbed part of the light spectrum is what gives photosynthetic organisms their color (e.g., green plants, red algae, purple bacteria) and is the least effective for photosynthesis in the respective organisms. Z scheme The \"Z scheme\" In plants, light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts where they drive the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. The light-dependent reactions are of two forms: cyclic and non-cyclic. In the non-cyclic reaction, the photons are captured in the light-harvesting antenna complexes of photosystem II by chlorophyll and other accessory pigments (see diagram \"Z-scheme\"). The absorption of a photon by the antenna complex loosens an electron by a process called photoinduced charge separation. The antenna system is at the core of the chlorophyll molecule of the photosystem II reaction center. That loosened electron is taken up by the primary electron-acceptor molecule, pheophytin. As the electrons are shuttled through an electron transport chain (the so-called Z-scheme shown in the diagram), a chemiosmotic potential is generated by pumping proton cations (H+) across the membrane and into the thylakoid space. An ATP synthase enzyme uses that chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during photophosphorylation, whereas NADPH is a product of the terminal redox reaction in the Z-scheme. The electron enters a chlorophyll molecule in Photosystem I. There it is further excited by the light absorbed by that photosystem. The electron is then passed along a chain of electron acceptors to which it transfers some of its energy. The energy delivered to the electron acceptors is used to move hydrogen ions across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. The electron is eventually used to reduce the coenzyme NADP with an H+ to NADPH (which has functions in the light-independent reaction); at that point, the path of that electron ends. The cyclic reaction is similar to that of the non-cyclic but differs in that it generates only ATP, and no reduced NADP (NADPH) is created. The cyclic reaction takes place only at photosystem I. Once the electron is displaced from the photosystem, the electron is passed down the electron acceptor molecules and returns to photosystem I, from where it was emitted, hence the name cyclic reaction. Water photolysis Main articles: Photodissociation and Oxygen evolution Linear electron transport through a photosystem will leave the reaction center of that photosystem oxidized. Elevating another electron will first require re-reduction of the reaction center. The excited electrons lost from the reaction center (P700) of photosystem I are replaced by transfer from plastocyanin, whose electrons come from electron transport through photosystem II. Photosystem II, as the first step of the Z-scheme, requires an external source of electrons to reduce its oxidized chlorophyll a reaction center. The source of electrons for photosynthesis in green plants and cyanobacteria is water. Two water molecules are oxidized by the energy of four successive charge-separation reactions of photosystem II to yield a molecule of diatomic oxygen and four hydrogen ions. The electrons yielded are transferred to a redox-active tyrosine residue that is oxidized by the energy of P680+. This resets the ability of P680 to absorb another photon and release another photo-dissociated electron. The oxidation of water is catalyzed in photosystem II by a redox-active structure that contains four manganese ions and a calcium ion; this oxygen-evolving complex binds two water molecules and contains the four oxidizing equivalents that are used to drive the water-oxidizing reaction (Kok's S-state diagrams). The hydrogen ions are released in the thylakoid lumen and therefore contribute to the transmembrane chemiosmotic potential that leads to ATP synthesis. Oxygen is a waste product of light-dependent reactions, but the majority of organisms on Earth use oxygen and its energy for cellular respiration, including photosynthetic organisms.[28][29] Light-independent reactions Calvin cycle Main articles: Calvin cycle and Carbon fixation In the light-independent (or \"dark\") reactions, the enzyme RuBisCO captures CO2 from the atmosphere and, in a process called the Calvin cycle, uses the newly formed NADPH and releases three-carbon sugars, which are later combined to form sucrose and starch. The overall equation for the light-independent reactions in green plants is[27]: 128 3 CO2 + 9 ATP + 6 NADPH + 6 H+ → C3H6O3-phosphate + 9 ADP + 8 Pi + 6 NADP+ + 3 H2O Overview of the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation Carbon fixation produces the three-carbon sugar intermediate, which is then converted into the final carbohydrate products. The simple carbon sugars photosynthesis produces are then used to form other organic compounds, such as the building material cellulose, the precursors for lipid and amino acid biosynthesis, or as a fuel in cellular respiration. The latter occurs not only in plants but also in animals when the carbon and energy from plants is passed through a food chain. The fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a process in which carbon dioxide combines with a five-carbon sugar, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, to yield two molecules of a three-carbon compound, glycerate 3-phosphate, also known as 3-phosphoglycerate. Glycerate 3-phosphate, in the presence of ATP and NADPH produced during the light-dependent stages, is reduced to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. This product is also referred to as 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) or, more generically, as triose phosphate. Most (five out of six molecules) of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced are used to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate so the process can continue. The triose phosphates not thus \"recycled\" often condense to form hexose phosphates, which ultimately yield sucrose, starch, and cellulose, as well as glucose and fructose. The sugars produced during carbon metabolism yield carbon skeletons that can be used for other metabolic reactions like the production of amino acids and lipids. Carbon concentrating mechanisms On land Main articles: C4 carbon fixation, CAM photosynthesis, and Alarm photosynthesis Overview of C4 carbon fixation. (This image mistakenly shows lactic acid instead of pyruvate, and all the species ending in \"-ate\" are shown as unionized acids, such as malic acid and so on). In hot and dry conditions, plants close their stomata to prevent water loss. Under these conditions, CO2 will decrease and oxygen gas, produced by the light reactions of photosynthesis, will increase, causing an increase of photorespiration by the oxygenase activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and decrease in carbon fixation. Some plants have evolved mechanisms to increase the CO2 concentration in the leaves under these conditions.[30] Plants that use the C4 carbon fixation process chemically fix carbon dioxide in the cells of the mesophyll by adding it to the three-carbon molecule phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called PEP carboxylase, creating the four-carbon organic acid oxaloacetic acid. Oxaloacetic acid or malate synthesized by this process is then translocated to specialized bundle sheath cells where the enzyme RuBisCO and other Calvin cycle enzymes are located, and where CO2 released by decarboxylation of the four-carbon acids is then fixed by RuBisCO activity to the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids. The physical separation of RuBisCO from the oxygen-generating light reactions reduces photorespiration and increases CO2 fixation and, thus, the photosynthetic capacity of the leaf.[31] C4 plants can produce more sugar than C3 plants in conditions of high light and temperature. Many important crop plants are C4 plants, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and millet. Plants that do not use PEP-carboxylase in carbon fixation are called C3 plants because the primary carboxylation reaction, catalyzed by RuBisCO, produces the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids directly in the Calvin-Benson cycle. Over 90% of plants use C3 carbon fixation, compared to 3% that use C4 carbon fixation;[32] however, the evolution of C4 in over sixty plant lineages makes it a striking example of convergent evolution.[30] C2 photosynthesis, which involves carbon-concentration by selective breakdown of photorespiratory glycine, is both an evolutionary precursor to C4 and a useful carbon-concentrating mechanism in its own right.[33] Xerophytes, such as cacti and most succulents, also use PEP carboxylase to capture carbon dioxide in a process called Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). In contrast to C4 metabolism, which spatially separates the CO2 fixation to PEP from the Calvin cycle, CAM temporally separates these two processes. CAM plants have a different leaf anatomy from C3 plants, and fix the CO2 at night, when their stomata are open. CAM plants store the CO2 mostly in the form of malic acid via carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate, which is then reduced to malate. Decarboxylation of malate during the day releases CO2 inside the leaves, thus allowing carbon fixation to 3-phosphoglycerate by RuBisCO. CAM is used by 16,000 species of plants.[34] Calcium-oxalate-accumulating plants, such as Amaranthus hybridus and Colobanthus quitensis, show a variation of photosynthesis where calcium oxalate crystals function as dynamic carbon pools, supplying carbon dioxide (CO2) to photosynthetic cells when stomata are partially or totally closed. This process was named alarm photosynthesis. Under stress conditions (e.g., water deficit), oxalate released from calcium oxalate crystals is converted to CO2 by an oxalate oxidase enzyme, and the produced CO2 can support the Calvin cycle reactions. Reactive hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the byproduct of oxalate oxidase reaction, can be neutralized by catalase. Alarm photosynthesis represents a photosynthetic variant to be added to the well-known C4 and CAM pathways. However, alarm photosynthesis, in contrast to these pathways, operates as a biochemical pump that collects carbon from the organ interior (or from the soil) and not from the atmosphere.[35][36] In water Cyanobacteria possess carboxysomes, which increase the concentration of CO2 around RuBisCO to increase the rate of photosynthesis. An enzyme, carbonic anhydrase, located within the carboxysome, releases CO2 from dissolved hydrocarbonate ions (HCO−3). Before the CO2 can diffuse out, RuBisCO concentrated within the carboxysome quickly sponges it up. HCO−3 ions are made from CO2 outside the cell by another carbonic anhydrase and are actively pumped into the cell by a membrane protein. They cannot cross the membrane as they are charged, and within the cytosol they turn back into CO2 very slowly without the help of carbonic anhydrase. This causes the HCO−3 ions to accumulate within the cell from where they diffuse into the carboxysomes.[37] Pyrenoids in algae and hornworts also act to concentrate CO2 around RuBisCO.[38][39] Order and kinetics The overall process of photosynthesis takes place in four stages:[11] Stage Event Site Time scale 1 Energy transfer in antenna chlorophyll Thylakoid membranes in the chloroplasts Femtosecond to picosecond 2 Transfer of electrons in photochemical reactions Picosecond to nanosecond 3 Electron transport chain and ATP synthesis Microsecond to millisecond 4 Carbon fixation and export of stable products Stroma of the chloroplasts and the cell cytosol Millisecond to second Efficiency Main article: Photosynthetic efficiency Plants usually convert light into chemical energy with a photosynthetic efficiency of 3–6%.[40][41] Absorbed light that is unconverted is dissipated primarily as heat, with a small fraction (1–2%) reemitted as chlorophyll fluorescence at longer (redder) wavelengths. This fact allows measurement of the light reaction of photosynthesis by using chlorophyll fluorometers.[42] Actual plants' photosynthetic efficiency varies with the frequency of the light being converted, light intensity, temperature, and proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and can vary from 0.1% to 8%.[43] By comparison, solar panels convert light into electric energy at an efficiency of approximately 6–20% for mass-produced panels, and above 40% in laboratory devices. Scientists are studying photosynthesis in hopes of developing plants with increased yield.[41] The efficiency of both light and dark reactions can be measured, but the relationship between the two can be complex. For example, the light reaction creates ATP and NADPH energy molecules, which C3 plants can use for carbon fixation or photorespiration.[44] Electrons may also flow to other electron sinks.[45][46][47] For this reason, it is not uncommon for authors to differentiate between work done under non-photorespiratory conditions and under photorespiratory conditions.[48][49][50] Chlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II can measure the light reaction, and infrared gas analyzers can measure the dark reaction.[51] An integrated chlorophyll fluorometer and gas exchange system can investigate both light and dark reactions when researchers use the two separate systems together.[52] Infrared gas analyzers and some moisture sensors are sensitive enough to measure the photosynthetic assimilation of CO2 and of ΔH2O using reliable methods. CO2 is commonly measured in μmols/(m2/s), parts per million, or volume per million; and H2O is commonly measured in mmols/(m2/s) or in mbars. By measuring CO2 assimilation, ΔH2O, leaf temperature, barometric pressure, leaf area, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), it becomes possible to estimate, \"A\" or carbon assimilation, \"E\" or transpiration, \"gs\" or stomatal conductance, and \"Ci\" or intracellular CO2.[53] However, it is more common to use chlorophyll fluorescence for plant stress measurement, where appropriate, because the most commonly used parameters FV/FM and Y(II) or F/FM' can be measured in a few seconds, allowing the investigation of larger plant populations.[50] Gas exchange systems that offer control of CO2 levels, above and below ambient, allow the common practice of measurement of A/Ci curves, at different CO2 levels, to characterize a plant's photosynthetic response.[53] Integrated chlorophyll fluorometer – gas exchange systems allow a more precise measure of photosynthetic response and mechanisms.[51][52] While standard gas exchange photosynthesis systems can measure Ci, or substomatal CO2 levels, the addition of integrated chlorophyll fluorescence measurements allows a more precise measurement of CC, the estimation of CO2 concentration at the site of carboxylation in the chloroplast, to replace Ci.[52][54] CO2 concentration in the chloroplast becomes possible to estimate with the measurement of mesophyll conductance or gm using an integrated system.[51][52][55] Photosynthesis measurement systems are not designed to directly measure the amount of light the leaf absorbs, but analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence, P700- and P515-absorbance, and gas exchange measurements reveal detailed information about, e.g., the photosystems, quantum efficiency and the CO2 assimilation rates. With some instruments, even wavelength dependency of the photosynthetic efficiency can be analyzed.[56] A phenomenon known as quantum walk increases the efficiency of the energy transport of light significantly. In the photosynthetic cell of an alga, bacterium, or plant, there are light-sensitive molecules called chromophores arranged in an antenna-shaped structure called a photocomplex. When a photon is absorbed by a chromophore, it is converted into a quasiparticle referred to as an exciton, which jumps from chromophore to chromophore towards the reaction center of the photocomplex, a collection of molecules that traps its energy in a chemical form accessible to the cell's metabolism. The exciton's wave properties enable it to cover a wider area and try out several possible paths simultaneously, allowing it to instantaneously \"choose\" the most efficient route, where it will have the highest probability of arriving at its destination in the minimum possible time. Because that quantum walking takes place at temperatures far higher than quantum phenomena usually occur, it is only possible over very short distances. Obstacles in the form of destructive interference cause the particle to lose its wave properties for an instant before it regains them once again after it is freed from its locked position through a classic \"hop\". The movement of the electron towards the photo center is therefore covered in a series of conventional hops and quantum walks.[57][58][59] Evolution Main article: Evolution of photosynthesis Life timelineThis box: viewtalkedit−4500 —–—–−4000 —–—–−3500 —–—–−3000 —–—–−2500 —–—–−2000 —–—–−1500 —–—–−1000 —–—–−500 —–—–0 — Water Single-celled life Photosynthesis Multicellular life Plants Arthropods MolluscsFlowersDinosaurs MammalsBirdsPrimatesHadeanArcheanProterozoicPhanerozoic ←Earth formed←Earliest water←LUCA←Earliest fossils←Atmospheric oxygen←Sexual reproduction←Earliest fungi←Greening of Earth←Ediacaran biota←Cambrian explosion←Earliest tetrapods←Earliest hominoid(million years ago) Fossils of what are thought to be filamentous photosynthetic organisms have been dated at 3.4 billion years old.[60][61] More recent studies also suggest that photosynthesis may have begun about 3.4 billion years ago,[62][63] though the first direct evidence of photosynthesis comes from thylakoid membranes preserved in 1.75-billion-year-old cherts.[64] Oxygenic photosynthesis is the main source of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere, and its earliest appearance is sometimes referred to as the oxygen catastrophe. Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, such as that in cyanobacteria, became important during the Paleoproterozoic era around two billion years ago. Modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic, using water as an electron donor, which is oxidized to molecular oxygen in the photosynthetic reaction center. Symbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts Plant cells with visible chloroplasts (from a moss, Plagiomnium affine) Several groups of animals have formed symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic algae. These are most common in corals, sponges, and sea anemones. Scientists presume that this is due to the particularly simple body plans and large surface areas of these animals compared to their volumes.[65] In addition, a few marine mollusks, such as Elysia viridis and Elysia chlorotica, also maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae in their diet and then store in their bodies (see Kleptoplasty). This allows the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time.[66][67] Some of the genes from the plant cell nucleus have even been transferred to the slugs, so that the chloroplasts can be supplied with proteins they need to survive.[68] An even closer form of symbiosis may explain the origin of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have many similarities with photosynthetic bacteria, including a circular chromosome, prokaryotic-type ribosome, and similar proteins in the photosynthetic reaction center.[69][70] The endosymbiotic theory suggests that photosynthetic bacteria were acquired (by endocytosis) by early eukaryotic cells to form the first plant cells. Therefore, chloroplasts may be photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts possess their own DNA, separate from the nuclear DNA of their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast DNA resemble those found in cyanobacteria.[71] DNA in chloroplasts codes for redox proteins such as those found in the photosynthetic reaction centers. The CoRR Hypothesis proposes that this co-location of genes with their gene products is required for redox regulation of gene expression, and accounts for the persistence of DNA in bioenergetic organelles.[72] Photosynthetic eukaryotic lineages Symbiotic and kleptoplastic organisms excluded: The glaucophytes and the red and green algae—clade Archaeplastida (uni- and multicellular) The cryptophytes—clade Cryptista (unicellular) The haptophytes—clade Haptista (unicellular) The dinoflagellates and chromerids in the superphylum Myzozoa, and Pseudoblepharisma in the phylum Ciliophora—clade Alveolata (unicellular) The ochrophytes—clade Stramenopila (uni- and multicellular) The chlorarachniophytes and three species of Paulinella in the phylum Cercozoa—clade Rhizaria (unicellular) The euglenids—clade Excavata (unicellular) Except for the euglenids, which are found within the Excavata, all of these belong to the Diaphoretickes. Archaeplastida and the photosynthetic Paulinella got their plastids, which are surrounded by two membranes, through primary endosymbiosis in two separate events, by engulfing a cyanobacterium. The plastids in all the other groups have either a red or green algal origin, and are referred to as the \"red lineages\" and the \"green lineages\". The only known exception is the ciliate Pseudoblepharisma tenue, which in addition to its plastids that originated from green algae also has a purple sulfur bacterium as symbiont. In dinoflagellates and euglenids the plastids are surrounded by three membranes, and in the remaining lines by four. A nucleomorph, remnants of the original algal nucleus located between the inner and outer membranes of the plastid, is present in the cryptophytes (from a red alga) and chlorarachniophytes (from a green alga).[73] Some dinoflagellates that lost their photosynthetic ability later regained it again through new endosymbiotic events with different algae. While able to perform photosynthesis, many of these eukaryotic groups are mixotrophs and practice heterotrophy to various degrees. Photosynthetic prokaryotic lineages Early photosynthetic systems, such as those in green and purple sulfur and green and purple nonsulfur bacteria, are thought to have been anoxygenic, and used various other molecules than water as electron donors. Green and purple sulfur bacteria are thought to have used hydrogen and sulfur as electron donors. Green nonsulfur bacteria used various amino and other organic acids as electron donors. Purple nonsulfur bacteria used a variety of nonspecific organic molecules. The use of these molecules is consistent with the geological evidence that Earth's early atmosphere was highly reducing at that time.[74] With a possible exception of Heimdallarchaeota, photosynthesis is not found in archaea.[75] Haloarchaea are photoheterotrophic; they can absorb energy from the sun, but do not harvest carbon from the atmosphere and are therefore not photosynthetic.[76] Instead of chlorophyll they use rhodopsins, which convert light-energy to ion gradients but cannot mediate electron transfer reactions.[77][78] In bacteria eight photosynthetic lineages are currently known:[79][80][81][82] Cyanobacteria, the only prokaryotes performing oxygenic photosynthesis and the only prokaryotes that contain two types of photosystems (type I (RCI), also known as Fe-S type, and type II (RCII), also known as quinone type). The seven remaining prokaryotes have anoxygenic photosynthesis and use versions of either type I or type II. Chlorobi (green sulfur bacteria) Type I Heliobacteria Type I Chloracidobacterium Type I Proteobacteria (purple sulfur bacteria and purple non-sulfur bacteria) Type II (see: Purple bacteria) Chloroflexota (green non-sulfur bacteria) Type II Gemmatimonadota Type II Eremiobacterota Type II Cyanobacteria and the evolution of photosynthesis The biochemical capacity to use water as the source for electrons in photosynthesis evolved once, in a common ancestor of extant cyanobacteria (formerly called blue-green algae). The geological record indicates that this transforming event took place early in Earth's history, at least 2450–2320 million years ago (Ma), and, it is speculated, much earlier.[83][84] Because the Earth's atmosphere contained almost no oxygen during the estimated development of photosynthesis, it is believed that the first photosynthetic cyanobacteria did not generate oxygen.[85] Available evidence from geobiological studies of Archean (>2500 Ma) sedimentary rocks indicates that life existed 3500 Ma, but the question of when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved is still unanswered. A clear paleontological window on cyanobacterial evolution opened about 2000 Ma, revealing an already-diverse biota of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria remained the principal primary producers of oxygen throughout the Proterozoic Eon (2500–543 Ma), in part because the redox structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of nitrogen fixation.[86][87] Green algae joined cyanobacteria as the major primary producers of oxygen on continental shelves near the end of the Proterozoic, but only with the Mesozoic (251–66 Ma) radiations of dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids, and diatoms did the primary production of oxygen in marine shelf waters take modern form. Cyanobacteria remain critical to marine ecosystems as primary producers of oxygen in oceanic gyres, as agents of biological nitrogen fixation, and, in modified form, as the plastids of marine algae.[88] Experimental history Discovery Although some of the steps in photosynthesis are still not completely understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 19th century. Portrait of Jan Baptist van Helmont by Mary Beale, c. 1674 Jan van Helmont began the research of the process in the mid-17th century when he carefully measured the mass of the soil a plant was using and the mass of the plant as it grew. After noticing that the soil mass changed very little, he hypothesized that the mass of the growing plant must come from the water, the only substance he added to the potted plant. His hypothesis was partially accurate – much of the gained mass comes from carbon dioxide as well as water. However, this was a signaling point to the idea that the bulk of a plant's biomass comes from the inputs of photosynthesis, not the soil itself. Joseph Priestley, a chemist and minister, discovered that when he isolated a volume of air under an inverted jar and burned a candle in it (which gave off CO2), the candle would burn out very quickly, much before it ran out of wax. He further discovered that a mouse could similarly \"injure\" air. He then showed that a plant could restore the air the candle and the mouse had \"injured.\"[89] In 1779, Jan Ingenhousz repeated Priestley's experiments. He discovered that it was the influence of sunlight on the plant that could cause it to revive a mouse in a matter of hours.[89][90] In 1796, Jean Senebier, a Swiss pastor, botanist, and naturalist, demonstrated that green plants consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen under the influence of light. Soon afterward, Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure showed that the increase in mass of the plant as it grows could not be due only to uptake of CO2 but also to the incorporation of water. Thus, the basic reaction by which organisms use photosynthesis to produce food (such as glucose) was outlined.[91] Refinements Cornelis Van Niel made key discoveries explaining the chemistry of photosynthesis. By studying purple sulfur bacteria and green bacteria, he was the first to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a light-dependent redox reaction in which hydrogen reduces (donates its atoms as electrons and protons to) carbon dioxide. Robert Emerson discovered two light reactions by testing plant productivity using different wavelengths of light. With the red alone, the light reactions were suppressed. When blue and red were combined, the output was much more substantial. Thus, there were two photosystems, one absorbing up to 600 nm wavelengths, the other up to 700 nm. The former is known as PSII, the latter is PSI. PSI contains only chlorophyll \"a\", PSII contains primarily chlorophyll \"a\" with most of the available chlorophyll \"b\", among other pigments. These include phycobilins, which are the red and blue pigments of red and blue algae, respectively, and fucoxanthol for brown algae and diatoms. The process is most productive when the absorption of quanta is equal in both PSII and PSI, assuring that input energy from the antenna complex is divided between the PSI and PSII systems, which in turn powers the photochemistry.[11] Robert Hill thought that a complex of reactions consisted of an intermediate to cytochrome b6 (now a plastoquinone), and that another was from cytochrome f to a step in the carbohydrate-generating mechanisms. These are linked by plastoquinone, which does require energy to reduce cytochrome f. Further experiments to prove that the oxygen developed during the photosynthesis of green plants came from water were performed by Hill in 1937 and 1939. He showed that isolated chloroplasts give off oxygen in the presence of unnatural reducing agents like iron oxalate, ferricyanide or benzoquinone after exposure to light. In the Hill reaction:[92] 2 H2O + 2 A + (light, chloroplasts) → 2 AH2 + O2 A is the electron acceptor. Therefore, in light, the electron acceptor is reduced and oxygen is evolved. Samuel Ruben and Martin Kamen used radioactive isotopes to determine that the oxygen liberated in photosynthesis came from the water. Melvin Calvin works in his photosynthesis laboratory. Melvin Calvin and Andrew Benson, along with James Bassham, elucidated the path of carbon assimilation (the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle) in plants. The carbon reduction cycle is known as the Calvin cycle, but many scientists refer to it as the Calvin-Benson, Benson-Calvin, or even Calvin-Benson-Bassham (or CBB) Cycle. Nobel Prize–winning scientist Rudolph A. Marcus was later able to discover the function and significance of the electron transport chain. Otto Heinrich Warburg and Dean Burk discovered the I-quantum photosynthesis reaction that splits CO2, activated by the respiration.[93] In 1950, first experimental evidence for the existence of photophosphorylation in vivo was presented by Otto Kandler using intact Chlorella cells and interpreting his findings as light-dependent ATP formation.[94] In 1954, Daniel I. Arnon et al. discovered photophosphorylation in vitro in isolated chloroplasts with the help of P32.[95][96] Louis N. M. Duysens and Jan Amesz discovered that chlorophyll \"a\" will absorb one light, oxidize cytochrome f, while chlorophyll \"a\" (and other pigments) will absorb another light but will reduce this same oxidized cytochrome, stating the two light reactions are in series. Development of the concept In 1893, the American botanist Charles Reid Barnes proposed two terms, photosyntax and photosynthesis, for the biological process of synthesis of complex carbon compounds out of carbonic acid, in the presence of chlorophyll, under the influence of light. The term photosynthesis is derived from the Greek phōs (φῶς, gleam) and sýnthesis (σύνθεσις, arranging together),[97][98][99] while another word that he designated was photosyntax, from sýntaxis (σύνταξις, configuration). Over time, the term photosynthesis came into common usage. Later discovery of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria and photophosphorylation necessitated redefinition of the term.[100] C3 : C4 photosynthesis research In the late 1940s at the University of California, Berkeley, the details of photosynthetic carbon metabolism were sorted out by the chemists Melvin Calvin, Andrew Benson, James Bassham and a score of students and researchers utilizing the carbon-14 isotope and paper chromatography techniques.[101] The pathway of CO2 fixation by the algae Chlorella in a fraction of a second in light resulted in a three carbon molecule called phosphoglyceric acid (PGA). For that original and ground-breaking work, a Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Melvin Calvin in 1961. In parallel, plant physiologists studied leaf gas exchanges using the new method of infrared gas analysis and a leaf chamber where the net photosynthetic rates ranged from 10 to 13 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1, with the conclusion that all terrestrial plants have the same photosynthetic capacities, that are light saturated at less than 50% of sunlight.[102][103] Later in 1958–1963 at Cornell University, field grown maize was reported to have much greater leaf photosynthetic rates of 40 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1 and not be saturated at near full sunlight.[104][105] This higher rate in maize was almost double of those observed in other species such as wheat and soybean, indicating that large differences in photosynthesis exist among higher plants. At the University of Arizona, detailed gas exchange research on more than 15 species of monocots and dicots uncovered for the first time that differences in leaf anatomy are crucial factors in differentiating photosynthetic capacities among species.[106][107] In tropical grasses, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, Bermuda grass and in the dicot amaranthus, leaf photosynthetic rates were around 38−40 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1, and the leaves have two types of green cells, i.e. outer layer of mesophyll cells surrounding a tightly packed cholorophyllous vascular bundle sheath cells. This type of anatomy was termed Kranz anatomy in the 19th century by the botanist Gottlieb Haberlandt while studying leaf anatomy of sugarcane.[108] Plant species with the greatest photosynthetic rates and Kranz anatomy showed no apparent photorespiration, very low CO2 compensation point, high optimum temperature, high stomatal resistances and lower mesophyll resistances for gas diffusion and rates never saturated at full sun light.[109] The research at Arizona was designated a Citation Classic in 1986.[107] These species were later termed C4 plants as the first stable compound of CO2 fixation in light has four carbons as malate and aspartate.[110][111][112] Other species that lack Kranz anatomy were termed C3 type such as cotton and sunflower, as the first stable carbon compound is the three-carbon PGA. At 1000 ppm CO2 in measuring air, both the C3 and C4 plants had similar leaf photosynthetic rates around 60 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1 indicating the suppression of photorespiration in C3 plants.[106][107] Factors The leaf is the primary site of photosynthesis in plants. There are four main factors influencing photosynthesis and several corollary factors. The four main are:[113] Light irradiance and wavelength Water absorption Carbon dioxide concentration Temperature. Total photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors. These include the amount of light available, the amount of leaf area a plant has to capture light (shading by other plants is a major limitation of photosynthesis), the rate at which carbon dioxide can be supplied to the chloroplasts to support photosynthesis, the availability of water, and the availability of suitable temperatures for carrying out photosynthesis.[114] Light intensity (irradiance), wavelength and temperature See also: PI (photosynthesis-irradiance) curve Absorbance spectra of free chlorophyll a (blue) and b (red) in a solvent. The action spectra of chlorophyll molecules are slightly modified in vivo depending on specific pigment–protein interactions. The process of photosynthesis provides the main input of free energy into the biosphere, and is one of four main ways in which radiation is important for plant life.[115] The radiation climate within plant communities is extremely variable, in both time and space. In the early 20th century, Frederick Blackman and Gabrielle Matthaei investigated the effects of light intensity (irradiance) and temperature on the rate of carbon assimilation. At constant temperature, the rate of carbon assimilation varies with irradiance, increasing as the irradiance increases, but reaching a plateau at higher irradiance. At low irradiance, increasing the temperature has little influence on the rate of carbon assimilation. At constant high irradiance, the rate of carbon assimilation increases as the temperature is increased. These two experiments illustrate several important points: First, it is known that, in general, photochemical reactions are not affected by temperature. However, these experiments clearly show that temperature affects the rate of carbon assimilation, so there must be two sets of reactions in the full process of carbon assimilation. These are the light-dependent 'photochemical' temperature-independent stage, and the light-independent, temperature-dependent stage. Second, Blackman's experiments illustrate the concept of limiting factors. Another limiting factor is the wavelength of light. Cyanobacteria, which reside several meters underwater, cannot receive the correct wavelengths required to cause photoinduced charge separation in conventional photosynthetic pigments. To combat this problem, Cyanobacteria have a light-harvesting complex called Phycobilisome.[116] This complex is made up of a series of proteins with different pigments which surround the reaction center. Carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration Photorespiration As carbon dioxide concentrations rise, the rate at which sugars are made by the light-independent reactions increases until limited by other factors. RuBisCO, the enzyme that captures carbon dioxide in the light-independent reactions, has a binding affinity for both carbon dioxide and oxygen. When the concentration of carbon dioxide is high, RuBisCO will fix carbon dioxide. However, if the carbon dioxide concentration is low, RuBisCO will bind oxygen instead of carbon dioxide. This process, called photorespiration, uses energy, but does not produce sugars. RuBisCO oxygenase activity is disadvantageous to plants for several reasons: One product of oxygenase activity is phosphoglycolate (2 carbon) instead of 3-phosphoglycerate (3 carbon). Phosphoglycolate cannot be metabolized by the Calvin-Benson cycle and represents carbon lost from the cycle. A high oxygenase activity, therefore, drains the sugars that are required to recycle ribulose 5-bisphosphate and for the continuation of the Calvin-Benson cycle. Phosphoglycolate is quickly metabolized to glycolate that is toxic to a plant at a high concentration; it inhibits photosynthesis. Salvaging glycolate is an energetically expensive process that uses the glycolate pathway, and only 75% of the carbon is returned to the Calvin-Benson cycle as 3-phosphoglycerate. The reactions also produce ammonia (NH3), which is able to diffuse out of the plant, leading to a loss of nitrogen. A highly simplified summary is: 2 glycolate + ATP → 3-phosphoglycerate + carbon dioxide + ADP + NH3 The salvaging pathway for the products of RuBisCO oxygenase activity is more commonly known as photorespiration, since it is characterized by light-dependent oxygen consumption and the release of carbon dioxide.

  "Biological process to convert light into chemical energy Schematic of photosynthesis in plants. The carbohydrates produced are stored in or used by the plant. Composite image showing the global distribution of photosynthesis, including both oceanic phytoplankton and terrestrial vegetation. Dark red and blue-green indicate regions of high photosynthetic activity in the ocean and on land, respectively. Photosynthesis (/ˌfoʊtəˈsɪnθəsɪs/ FOH-tə-SINTH-ə-sis)[1] is a system of biological processes by which photosynthetic organisms, such as most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, convert light energy, typically from sunlight, into the chemical energy necessary to fuel their metabolism. Photosynthesis usually refers to oxygenic photosynthesis, a process that produces oxygen. Photosynthetic organisms store the chemical energy so produced within intracellular organic compounds (compounds containing carbon) like sugars, glycogen, cellulose and starches. To use this stored chemical energy, an organism's cells metabolize the organic compounds through cellular respiration. Photosynthesis plays a critical role in producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and it supplies most of the biological energy necessary for complex life on Earth.[2] Some bacteria also perform anoxygenic photosynthesis, which uses bacteriochlorophyll to split hydrogen sulfide as a reductant instead of water, producing sulfur instead of oxygen. Archaea such as Halobacterium also perform a type of non-carbon-fixing anoxygenic photosynthesis, where the simpler photopigment retinal and its microbial rhodopsin derivatives are used to absorb green light and power proton pumps to directly synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the \"energy currency\" of cells. Such archaeal photosynthesis might have been the earliest form of photosynthesis that evolved on Earth, as far back as the Paleoarchean, preceding that of cyanobacteria (see Purple Earth hypothesis). While the details may differ between species, the process always begins when light energy is absorbed by the reaction centers, proteins that contain photosynthetic pigments or chromophores. In plants, these pigments are chlorophylls (a porphyrin derivative that absorbs the red and blue spectrums of light, thus reflecting green) held inside chloroplasts, abundant in leaf cells. In bacteria, they are embedded in the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two important molecules that participate in energetic processes: reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and ATP. In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, sugars are synthesized by a subsequent sequence of light-independent reactions called the Calvin cycle. In this process, atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated into already existing organic compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP).[3] Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as glucose. In other bacteria, different mechanisms like the reverse Krebs cycle are used to achieve the same end. The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life using reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide, rather than water, as sources of electrons.[4] Cyanobacteria appeared later; the excess oxygen they produced contributed directly to the oxygenation of the Earth,[5] which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. The average rate of energy captured by global photosynthesis is approximately 130 terawatts,[6][7][8] which is about eight times the total power consumption of human civilization.[9] Photosynthetic organisms also convert around 100–115 billion tons (91–104 Pg petagrams, or billions of metric tons), of carbon into biomass per year.[10][11] Photosynthesis was discovered in 1779 by Jan Ingenhousz who showed that plants need light, not just soil and water. Overview Main article: Biological carbon fixation Photosynthesis changes sunlight into chemical energy, splits water to liberate O2, and fixes CO2 into sugar. Most photosynthetic organisms are photoautotrophs, which means that they are able to synthesize food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from light. However, not all organisms use carbon dioxide as a source of carbon atoms to carry out photosynthesis; photoheterotrophs use organic compounds, rather than carbon dioxide, as a source of carbon.[2] In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen. This oxygenic photosynthesis is by far the most common type of photosynthesis used by living organisms. Some shade-loving plants (sciophytes) produce such low levels of oxygen during photosynthesis that they use all of it themselves instead of releasing it to the atmosphere.[12] Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, the overall process is quite similar in these organisms. There are also many varieties of anoxygenic photosynthesis, used mostly by bacteria, which consume carbon dioxide but do not release oxygen or which produce elemental sulfur instead of molecular oxygen.[13][14] Carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called carbon fixation; photosynthesis captures energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates. Carbon fixation is an endothermic redox reaction. In general outline, photosynthesis is the opposite of cellular respiration: while photosynthesis is a process of reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates, cellular respiration is the oxidation of carbohydrates or other nutrients to carbon dioxide. Nutrients used in cellular respiration include carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids. These nutrients are oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water, and to release chemical energy to drive the organism's metabolism. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are distinct processes, as they take place through different sequences of chemical reactions and in different cellular compartments (cellular respiration in mitochondria).[15][16] The general equation for photosynthesis as first proposed by Cornelis van Niel is:[17] CO2carbondioxide + 2H2Aelectron donor + photonslight energy → [CH2O]carbohydrate + 2Aoxidizedelectrondonor + H2Owater Since water is used as the electron donor in oxygenic photosynthesis, the equation for this process is: CO2carbondioxide + 2H2Owater + photonslight energy → [CH2O]carbohydrate + O2oxygen + H2Owater This equation emphasizes that water is both a reactant in the light-dependent reaction and a product of the light-independent reaction, but canceling n water molecules from each side gives the net equation: CO2carbondioxide + H2O water + photonslight energy → [CH2O]carbohydrate + O2 oxygen Other processes substitute other compounds (such as arsenite) for water in the electron-supply role; for example some microbes use sunlight to oxidize arsenite to arsenate:[18] The equation for this reaction is: CO2carbondioxide + (AsO3−3)arsenite + photonslight energy → (AsO3−4)arsenate + COcarbonmonoxide(used to build other compounds in subsequent reactions)[19] Photosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, light-dependent reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the hydrogen carrier NADPH and the energy-storage molecule ATP. During the second stage, the light-independent reactions use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide. Most organisms that use oxygenic photosynthesis use visible light for the light-dependent reactions, although at least three use shortwave infrared or, more specifically, far-red radiation.[20] Some organisms employ even more radical variants of photosynthesis. Some archaea use a simpler method that employs a pigment similar to those used for vision in animals. The bacteriorhodopsin changes its configuration in response to sunlight, acting as a proton pump. This produces a proton gradient more directly, which is then converted to chemical energy. The process does not involve carbon dioxide fixation and does not release oxygen, and seems to have evolved separately from the more common types of photosynthesis.[21] Photosynthetic membranes and organelles Main articles: Chloroplast and Thylakoid Chloroplast ultrastructure:outer membraneintermembrane spaceinner membrane (1+2+3: envelope)stroma (aqueous fluid)thylakoid lumen (inside of thylakoid)thylakoid membranegranum (stack of thylakoids)thylakoid (lamella)starchribosomeplastidial DNAplastoglobule (drop of lipids) In photosynthetic bacteria, the proteins that gather light for photosynthesis are embedded in cell membranes. In its simplest form, this involves the membrane surrounding the cell itself.[22] However, the membrane may be tightly folded into cylindrical sheets called thylakoids,[23] or bunched up into round vesicles called intracytoplasmic membranes.[24] These structures can fill most of the interior of a cell, giving the membrane a very large surface area and therefore increasing the amount of light that the bacteria can absorb.[23] In plants and algae, photosynthesis takes place in organelles called chloroplasts. A typical plant cell contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts. The chloroplast is enclosed by a membrane. This membrane is composed of a phospholipid inner membrane, a phospholipid outer membrane, and an intermembrane space. Enclosed by the membrane is an aqueous fluid called the stroma. Embedded within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids (grana), which are the site of photosynthesis. The thylakoids appear as flattened disks. The thylakoid itself is enclosed by the thylakoid membrane, and within the enclosed volume is a lumen or thylakoid space. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane are integral and peripheral membrane protein complexes of the photosynthetic system. Plants absorb light primarily using the pigment chlorophyll. The green part of the light spectrum is not absorbed but is reflected, which is the reason that most plants have a green color. Besides chlorophyll, plants also use pigments such as carotenes and xanthophylls.[25] Algae also use chlorophyll, but various other pigments are present, such as phycocyanin, carotenes, and xanthophylls in green algae, phycoerythrin in red algae (rhodophytes) and fucoxanthin in brown algae and diatoms resulting in a wide variety of colors. These pigments are embedded in plants and algae in complexes called antenna proteins. In such proteins, the pigments are arranged to work together. Such a combination of proteins is also called a light-harvesting complex.[26] Although all cells in the green parts of a plant have chloroplasts, the majority of those are found in specially adapted structures called leaves. Certain species adapted to conditions of strong sunlight and aridity, such as many Euphorbia and cactus species, have their main photosynthetic organs in their stems. The cells in the interior tissues of a leaf, called the mesophyll, can contain between 450,000 and 800,000 chloroplasts for every square millimeter of leaf. The surface of the leaf is coated with a water-resistant waxy cuticle that protects the leaf from excessive evaporation of water and decreases the absorption of ultraviolet or blue light to minimize heating. The transparent epidermis layer allows light to pass through to the palisade mesophyll cells where most of the photosynthesis takes place. Light-dependent reactions Main article: Light-dependent reactions Light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis at the thylakoid membrane In the light-dependent reactions, one molecule of the pigment chlorophyll absorbs one photon and loses one electron. This electron is taken up by a modified form of chlorophyll called pheophytin, which passes the electron to a quinone molecule, starting the flow of electrons down an electron transport chain that leads to the ultimate reduction of NADP to NADPH. In addition, this creates a proton gradient (energy gradient) across the chloroplast membrane, which is used by ATP synthase in the synthesis of ATP. The chlorophyll molecule ultimately regains the electron it lost when a water molecule is split in a process called photolysis, which releases oxygen. The overall equation for the light-dependent reactions under the conditions of non-cyclic electron flow in green plants is:[27] 2 H2O + 2 NADP+ + 3 ADP + 3 Pi + light → 2 NADPH + 2 H+ + 3 ATP + O2 Not all wavelengths of light can support photosynthesis. The photosynthetic action spectrum depends on the type of accessory pigments present. For example, in green plants, the action spectrum resembles the absorption spectrum for chlorophylls and carotenoids with absorption peaks in violet-blue and red light. In red algae, the action spectrum is blue-green light, which allows these algae to use the blue end of the spectrum to grow in the deeper waters that filter out the longer wavelengths (red light) used by above-ground green plants. The non-absorbed part of the light spectrum is what gives photosynthetic organisms their color (e.g., green plants, red algae, purple bacteria) and is the least effective for photosynthesis in the respective organisms. Z scheme The \"Z scheme\" In plants, light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts where they drive the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. The light-dependent reactions are of two forms: cyclic and non-cyclic. In the non-cyclic reaction, the photons are captured in the light-harvesting antenna complexes of photosystem II by chlorophyll and other accessory pigments (see diagram \"Z-scheme\"). The absorption of a photon by the antenna complex loosens an electron by a process called photoinduced charge separation. The antenna system is at the core of the chlorophyll molecule of the photosystem II reaction center. That loosened electron is taken up by the primary electron-acceptor molecule, pheophytin. As the electrons are shuttled through an electron transport chain (the so-called Z-scheme shown in the diagram), a chemiosmotic potential is generated by pumping proton cations (H+) across the membrane and into the thylakoid space. An ATP synthase enzyme uses that chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during photophosphorylation, whereas NADPH is a product of the terminal redox reaction in the Z-scheme. The electron enters a chlorophyll molecule in Photosystem I. There it is further excited by the light absorbed by that photosystem. The electron is then passed along a chain of electron acceptors to which it transfers some of its energy. The energy delivered to the electron acceptors is used to move hydrogen ions across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. The electron is eventually used to reduce the coenzyme NADP with an H+ to NADPH (which has functions in the light-independent reaction); at that point, the path of that electron ends. The cyclic reaction is similar to that of the non-cyclic but differs in that it generates only ATP, and no reduced NADP (NADPH) is created. The cyclic reaction takes place only at photosystem I. Once the electron is displaced from the photosystem, the electron is passed down the electron acceptor molecules and returns to photosystem I, from where it was emitted, hence the name cyclic reaction. Water photolysis Main articles: Photodissociation and Oxygen evolution Linear electron transport through a photosystem will leave the reaction center of that photosystem oxidized. Elevating another electron will first require re-reduction of the reaction center. The excited electrons lost from the reaction center (P700) of photosystem I are replaced by transfer from plastocyanin, whose electrons come from electron transport through photosystem II. Photosystem II, as the first step of the Z-scheme, requires an external source of electrons to reduce its oxidized chlorophyll a reaction center. The source of electrons for photosynthesis in green plants and cyanobacteria is water. Two water molecules are oxidized by the energy of four successive charge-separation reactions of photosystem II to yield a molecule of diatomic oxygen and four hydrogen ions. The electrons yielded are transferred to a redox-active tyrosine residue that is oxidized by the energy of P680+. This resets the ability of P680 to absorb another photon and release another photo-dissociated electron. The oxidation of water is catalyzed in photosystem II by a redox-active structure that contains four manganese ions and a calcium ion; this oxygen-evolving complex binds two water molecules and contains the four oxidizing equivalents that are used to drive the water-oxidizing reaction (Kok's S-state diagrams). The hydrogen ions are released in the thylakoid lumen and therefore contribute to the transmembrane chemiosmotic potential that leads to ATP synthesis. Oxygen is a waste product of light-dependent reactions, but the majority of organisms on Earth use oxygen and its energy for cellular respiration, including photosynthetic organisms.[28][29] Light-independent reactions Calvin cycle Main articles: Calvin cycle and Carbon fixation In the light-independent (or \"dark\") reactions, the enzyme RuBisCO captures CO2 from the atmosphere and, in a process called the Calvin cycle, uses the newly formed NADPH and releases three-carbon sugars, which are later combined to form sucrose and starch. The overall equation for the light-independent reactions in green plants is[27]: 128 3 CO2 + 9 ATP + 6 NADPH + 6 H+ → C3H6O3-phosphate + 9 ADP + 8 Pi + 6 NADP+ + 3 H2O Overview of the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation Carbon fixation produces the three-carbon sugar intermediate, which is then converted into the final carbohydrate products. The simple carbon sugars photosynthesis produces are then used to form other organic compounds, such as the building material cellulose, the precursors for lipid and amino acid biosynthesis, or as a fuel in cellular respiration. The latter occurs not only in plants but also in animals when the carbon and energy from plants is passed through a food chain. The fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a process in which carbon dioxide combines with a five-carbon sugar, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, to yield two molecules of a three-carbon compound, glycerate 3-phosphate, also known as 3-phosphoglycerate. Glycerate 3-phosphate, in the presence of ATP and NADPH produced during the light-dependent stages, is reduced to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. This product is also referred to as 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) or, more generically, as triose phosphate. Most (five out of six molecules) of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced are used to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate so the process can continue. The triose phosphates not thus \"recycled\" often condense to form hexose phosphates, which ultimately yield sucrose, starch, and cellulose, as well as glucose and fructose. The sugars produced during carbon metabolism yield carbon skeletons that can be used for other metabolic reactions like the production of amino acids and lipids. Carbon concentrating mechanisms On land Main articles: C4 carbon fixation, CAM photosynthesis, and Alarm photosynthesis Overview of C4 carbon fixation. (This image mistakenly shows lactic acid instead of pyruvate, and all the species ending in \"-ate\" are shown as unionized acids, such as malic acid and so on). In hot and dry conditions, plants close their stomata to prevent water loss. Under these conditions, CO2 will decrease and oxygen gas, produced by the light reactions of photosynthesis, will increase, causing an increase of photorespiration by the oxygenase activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and decrease in carbon fixation. Some plants have evolved mechanisms to increase the CO2 concentration in the leaves under these conditions.[30] Plants that use the C4 carbon fixation process chemically fix carbon dioxide in the cells of the mesophyll by adding it to the three-carbon molecule phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called PEP carboxylase, creating the four-carbon organic acid oxaloacetic acid. Oxaloacetic acid or malate synthesized by this process is then translocated to specialized bundle sheath cells where the enzyme RuBisCO and other Calvin cycle enzymes are located, and where CO2 released by decarboxylation of the four-carbon acids is then fixed by RuBisCO activity to the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids. The physical separation of RuBisCO from the oxygen-generating light reactions reduces photorespiration and increases CO2 fixation and, thus, the photosynthetic capacity of the leaf.[31] C4 plants can produce more sugar than C3 plants in conditions of high light and temperature. Many important crop plants are C4 plants, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and millet. Plants that do not use PEP-carboxylase in carbon fixation are called C3 plants because the primary carboxylation reaction, catalyzed by RuBisCO, produces the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids directly in the Calvin-Benson cycle. Over 90% of plants use C3 carbon fixation, compared to 3% that use C4 carbon fixation;[32] however, the evolution of C4 in over sixty plant lineages makes it a striking example of convergent evolution.[30] C2 photosynthesis, which involves carbon-concentration by selective breakdown of photorespiratory glycine, is both an evolutionary precursor to C4 and a useful carbon-concentrating mechanism in its own right.[33] Xerophytes, such as cacti and most succulents, also use PEP carboxylase to capture carbon dioxide in a process called Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). In contrast to C4 metabolism, which spatially separates the CO2 fixation to PEP from the Calvin cycle, CAM temporally separates these two processes. CAM plants have a different leaf anatomy from C3 plants, and fix the CO2 at night, when their stomata are open. CAM plants store the CO2 mostly in the form of malic acid via carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate, which is then reduced to malate. Decarboxylation of malate during the day releases CO2 inside the leaves, thus allowing carbon fixation to 3-phosphoglycerate by RuBisCO. CAM is used by 16,000 species of plants.[34] Calcium-oxalate-accumulating plants, such as Amaranthus hybridus and Colobanthus quitensis, show a variation of photosynthesis where calcium oxalate crystals function as dynamic carbon pools, supplying carbon dioxide (CO2) to photosynthetic cells when stomata are partially or totally closed. This process was named alarm photosynthesis. Under stress conditions (e.g., water deficit), oxalate released from calcium oxalate crystals is converted to CO2 by an oxalate oxidase enzyme, and the produced CO2 can support the Calvin cycle reactions. Reactive hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the byproduct of oxalate oxidase reaction, can be neutralized by catalase. Alarm photosynthesis represents a photosynthetic variant to be added to the well-known C4 and CAM pathways. However, alarm photosynthesis, in contrast to these pathways, operates as a biochemical pump that collects carbon from the organ interior (or from the soil) and not from the atmosphere.[35][36] In water Cyanobacteria possess carboxysomes, which increase the concentration of CO2 around RuBisCO to increase the rate of photosynthesis. An enzyme, carbonic anhydrase, located within the carboxysome, releases CO2 from dissolved hydrocarbonate ions (HCO−3). Before the CO2 can diffuse out, RuBisCO concentrated within the carboxysome quickly sponges it up. HCO−3 ions are made from CO2 outside the cell by another carbonic anhydrase and are actively pumped into the cell by a membrane protein. They cannot cross the membrane as they are charged, and within the cytosol they turn back into CO2 very slowly without the help of carbonic anhydrase. This causes the HCO−3 ions to accumulate within the cell from where they diffuse into the carboxysomes.[37] Pyrenoids in algae and hornworts also act to concentrate CO2 around RuBisCO.[38][39] Order and kinetics The overall process of photosynthesis takes place in four stages:[11] Stage Event Site Time scale 1 Energy transfer in antenna chlorophyll Thylakoid membranes in the chloroplasts Femtosecond to picosecond 2 Transfer of electrons in photochemical reactions Picosecond to nanosecond 3 Electron transport chain and ATP synthesis Microsecond to millisecond 4 Carbon fixation and export of stable products Stroma of the chloroplasts and the cell cytosol Millisecond to second Efficiency Main article: Photosynthetic efficiency Plants usually convert light into chemical energy with a photosynthetic efficiency of 3–6%.[40][41] Absorbed light that is unconverted is dissipated primarily as heat, with a small fraction (1–2%) reemitted as chlorophyll fluorescence at longer (redder) wavelengths. This fact allows measurement of the light reaction of photosynthesis by using chlorophyll fluorometers.[42] Actual plants' photosynthetic efficiency varies with the frequency of the light being converted, light intensity, temperature, and proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and can vary from 0.1% to 8%.[43] By comparison, solar panels convert light into electric energy at an efficiency of approximately 6–20% for mass-produced panels, and above 40% in laboratory devices. Scientists are studying photosynthesis in hopes of developing plants with increased yield.[41] The efficiency of both light and dark reactions can be measured, but the relationship between the two can be complex. For example, the light reaction creates ATP and NADPH energy molecules, which C3 plants can use for carbon fixation or photorespiration.[44] Electrons may also flow to other electron sinks.[45][46][47] For this reason, it is not uncommon for authors to differentiate between work done under non-photorespiratory conditions and under photorespiratory conditions.[48][49][50] Chlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II can measure the light reaction, and infrared gas analyzers can measure the dark reaction.[51] An integrated chlorophyll fluorometer and gas exchange system can investigate both light and dark reactions when researchers use the two separate systems together.[52] Infrared gas analyzers and some moisture sensors are sensitive enough to measure the photosynthetic assimilation of CO2 and of ΔH2O using reliable methods. CO2 is commonly measured in μmols/(m2/s), parts per million, or volume per million; and H2O is commonly measured in mmols/(m2/s) or in mbars. By measuring CO2 assimilation, ΔH2O, leaf temperature, barometric pressure, leaf area, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), it becomes possible to estimate, \"A\" or carbon assimilation, \"E\" or transpiration, \"gs\" or stomatal conductance, and \"Ci\" or intracellular CO2.[53] However, it is more common to use chlorophyll fluorescence for plant stress measurement, where appropriate, because the most commonly used parameters FV/FM and Y(II) or F/FM' can be measured in a few seconds, allowing the investigation of larger plant populations.[50] Gas exchange systems that offer control of CO2 levels, above and below ambient, allow the common practice of measurement of A/Ci curves, at different CO2 levels, to characterize a plant's photosynthetic response.[53] Integrated chlorophyll fluorometer – gas exchange systems allow a more precise measure of photosynthetic response and mechanisms.[51][52] While standard gas exchange photosynthesis systems can measure Ci, or substomatal CO2 levels, the addition of integrated chlorophyll fluorescence measurements allows a more precise measurement of CC, the estimation of CO2 concentration at the site of carboxylation in the chloroplast, to replace Ci.[52][54] CO2 concentration in the chloroplast becomes possible to estimate with the measurement of mesophyll conductance or gm using an integrated system.[51][52][55] Photosynthesis measurement systems are not designed to directly measure the amount of light the leaf absorbs, but analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence, P700- and P515-absorbance, and gas exchange measurements reveal detailed information about, e.g., the photosystems, quantum efficiency and the CO2 assimilation rates. With some instruments, even wavelength dependency of the photosynthetic efficiency can be analyzed.[56] A phenomenon known as quantum walk increases the efficiency of the energy transport of light significantly. In the photosynthetic cell of an alga, bacterium, or plant, there are light-sensitive molecules called chromophores arranged in an antenna-shaped structure called a photocomplex. When a photon is absorbed by a chromophore, it is converted into a quasiparticle referred to as an exciton, which jumps from chromophore to chromophore towards the reaction center of the photocomplex, a collection of molecules that traps its energy in a chemical form accessible to the cell's metabolism. The exciton's wave properties enable it to cover a wider area and try out several possible paths simultaneously, allowing it to instantaneously \"choose\" the most efficient route, where it will have the highest probability of arriving at its destination in the minimum possible time. Because that quantum walking takes place at temperatures far higher than quantum phenomena usually occur, it is only possible over very short distances. Obstacles in the form of destructive interference cause the particle to lose its wave properties for an instant before it regains them once again after it is freed from its locked position through a classic \"hop\". The movement of the electron towards the photo center is therefore covered in a series of conventional hops and quantum walks.[57][58][59] Evolution Main article: Evolution of photosynthesis Life timelineThis box: viewtalkedit−4500 —–—–−4000 —–—–−3500 —–—–−3000 —–—–−2500 —–—–−2000 —–—–−1500 —–—–−1000 —–—–−500 —–—–0 — Water Single-celled life Photosynthesis Multicellular life Plants Arthropods MolluscsFlowersDinosaurs MammalsBirdsPrimatesHadeanArcheanProterozoicPhanerozoic ←Earth formed←Earliest water←LUCA←Earliest fossils←Atmospheric oxygen←Sexual reproduction←Earliest fungi←Greening of Earth←Ediacaran biota←Cambrian explosion←Earliest tetrapods←Earliest hominoid(million years ago) Fossils of what are thought to be filamentous photosynthetic organisms have been dated at 3.4 billion years old.[60][61] More recent studies also suggest that photosynthesis may have begun about 3.4 billion years ago,[62][63] though the first direct evidence of photosynthesis comes from thylakoid membranes preserved in 1.75-billion-year-old cherts.[64] Oxygenic photosynthesis is the main source of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere, and its earliest appearance is sometimes referred to as the oxygen catastrophe. Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, such as that in cyanobacteria, became important during the Paleoproterozoic era around two billion years ago. Modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic, using water as an electron donor, which is oxidized to molecular oxygen in the photosynthetic reaction center. Symbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts Plant cells with visible chloroplasts (from a moss, Plagiomnium affine) Several groups of animals have formed symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic algae. These are most common in corals, sponges, and sea anemones. Scientists presume that this is due to the particularly simple body plans and large surface areas of these animals compared to their volumes.[65] In addition, a few marine mollusks, such as Elysia viridis and Elysia chlorotica, also maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae in their diet and then store in their bodies (see Kleptoplasty). This allows the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time.[66][67] Some of the genes from the plant cell nucleus have even been transferred to the slugs, so that the chloroplasts can be supplied with proteins they need to survive.[68] An even closer form of symbiosis may explain the origin of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have many similarities with photosynthetic bacteria, including a circular chromosome, prokaryotic-type ribosome, and similar proteins in the photosynthetic reaction center.[69][70] The endosymbiotic theory suggests that photosynthetic bacteria were acquired (by endocytosis) by early eukaryotic cells to form the first plant cells. Therefore, chloroplasts may be photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts possess their own DNA, separate from the nuclear DNA of their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast DNA resemble those found in cyanobacteria.[71] DNA in chloroplasts codes for redox proteins such as those found in the photosynthetic reaction centers. The CoRR Hypothesis proposes that this co-location of genes with their gene products is required for redox regulation of gene expression, and accounts for the persistence of DNA in bioenergetic organelles.[72] Photosynthetic eukaryotic lineages Symbiotic and kleptoplastic organisms excluded: The glaucophytes and the red and green algae—clade Archaeplastida (uni- and multicellular) The cryptophytes—clade Cryptista (unicellular) The haptophytes—clade Haptista (unicellular) The dinoflagellates and chromerids in the superphylum Myzozoa, and Pseudoblepharisma in the phylum Ciliophora—clade Alveolata (unicellular) The ochrophytes—clade Stramenopila (uni- and multicellular) The chlorarachniophytes and three species of Paulinella in the phylum Cercozoa—clade Rhizaria (unicellular) The euglenids—clade Excavata (unicellular) Except for the euglenids, which are found within the Excavata, all of these belong to the Diaphoretickes. Archaeplastida and the photosynthetic Paulinella got their plastids, which are surrounded by two membranes, through primary endosymbiosis in two separate events, by engulfing a cyanobacterium. The plastids in all the other groups have either a red or green algal origin, and are referred to as the \"red lineages\" and the \"green lineages\". The only known exception is the ciliate Pseudoblepharisma tenue, which in addition to its plastids that originated from green algae also has a purple sulfur bacterium as symbiont. In dinoflagellates and euglenids the plastids are surrounded by three membranes, and in the remaining lines by four. A nucleomorph, remnants of the original algal nucleus located between the inner and outer membranes of the plastid, is present in the cryptophytes (from a red alga) and chlorarachniophytes (from a green alga).[73] Some dinoflagellates that lost their photosynthetic ability later regained it again through new endosymbiotic events with different algae. While able to perform photosynthesis, many of these eukaryotic groups are mixotrophs and practice heterotrophy to various degrees. Photosynthetic prokaryotic lineages Early photosynthetic systems, such as those in green and purple sulfur and green and purple nonsulfur bacteria, are thought to have been anoxygenic, and used various other molecules than water as electron donors. Green and purple sulfur bacteria are thought to have used hydrogen and sulfur as electron donors. Green nonsulfur bacteria used various amino and other organic acids as electron donors. Purple nonsulfur bacteria used a variety of nonspecific organic molecules. The use of these molecules is consistent with the geological evidence that Earth's early atmosphere was highly reducing at that time.[74] With a possible exception of Heimdallarchaeota, photosynthesis is not found in archaea.[75] Haloarchaea are photoheterotrophic; they can absorb energy from the sun, but do not harvest carbon from the atmosphere and are therefore not photosynthetic.[76] Instead of chlorophyll they use rhodopsins, which convert light-energy to ion gradients but cannot mediate electron transfer reactions.[77][78] In bacteria eight photosynthetic lineages are currently known:[79][80][81][82] Cyanobacteria, the only prokaryotes performing oxygenic photosynthesis and the only prokaryotes that contain two types of photosystems (type I (RCI), also known as Fe-S type, and type II (RCII), also known as quinone type). The seven remaining prokaryotes have anoxygenic photosynthesis and use versions of either type I or type II. Chlorobi (green sulfur bacteria) Type I Heliobacteria Type I Chloracidobacterium Type I Proteobacteria (purple sulfur bacteria and purple non-sulfur bacteria) Type II (see: Purple bacteria) Chloroflexota (green non-sulfur bacteria) Type II Gemmatimonadota Type II Eremiobacterota Type II Cyanobacteria and the evolution of photosynthesis The biochemical capacity to use water as the source for electrons in photosynthesis evolved once, in a common ancestor of extant cyanobacteria (formerly called blue-green algae). The geological record indicates that this transforming event took place early in Earth's history, at least 2450–2320 million years ago (Ma), and, it is speculated, much earlier.[83][84] Because the Earth's atmosphere contained almost no oxygen during the estimated development of photosynthesis, it is believed that the first photosynthetic cyanobacteria did not generate oxygen.[85] Available evidence from geobiological studies of Archean (>2500 Ma) sedimentary rocks indicates that life existed 3500 Ma, but the question of when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved is still unanswered. A clear paleontological window on cyanobacterial evolution opened about 2000 Ma, revealing an already-diverse biota of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria remained the principal primary producers of oxygen throughout the Proterozoic Eon (2500–543 Ma), in part because the redox structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of nitrogen fixation.[86][87] Green algae joined cyanobacteria as the major primary producers of oxygen on continental shelves near the end of the Proterozoic, but only with the Mesozoic (251–66 Ma) radiations of dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids, and diatoms did the primary production of oxygen in marine shelf waters take modern form. Cyanobacteria remain critical to marine ecosystems as primary producers of oxygen in oceanic gyres, as agents of biological nitrogen fixation, and, in modified form, as the plastids of marine algae.[88] Experimental history Discovery Although some of the steps in photosynthesis are still not completely understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 19th century. Portrait of Jan Baptist van Helmont by Mary Beale, c. 1674 Jan van Helmont began the research of the process in the mid-17th century when he carefully measured the mass of the soil a plant was using and the mass of the plant as it grew. After noticing that the soil mass changed very little, he hypothesized that the mass of the growing plant must come from the water, the only substance he added to the potted plant. His hypothesis was partially accurate – much of the gained mass comes from carbon dioxide as well as water. However, this was a signaling point to the idea that the bulk of a plant's biomass comes from the inputs of photosynthesis, not the soil itself. Joseph Priestley, a chemist and minister, discovered that when he isolated a volume of air under an inverted jar and burned a candle in it (which gave off CO2), the candle would burn out very quickly, much before it ran out of wax. He further discovered that a mouse could similarly \"injure\" air. He then showed that a plant could restore the air the candle and the mouse had \"injured.\"[89] In 1779, Jan Ingenhousz repeated Priestley's experiments. He discovered that it was the influence of sunlight on the plant that could cause it to revive a mouse in a matter of hours.[89][90] In 1796, Jean Senebier, a Swiss pastor, botanist, and naturalist, demonstrated that green plants consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen under the influence of light. Soon afterward, Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure showed that the increase in mass of the plant as it grows could not be due only to uptake of CO2 but also to the incorporation of water. Thus, the basic reaction by which organisms use photosynthesis to produce food (such as glucose) was outlined.[91] Refinements Cornelis Van Niel made key discoveries explaining the chemistry of photosynthesis. By studying purple sulfur bacteria and green bacteria, he was the first to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a light-dependent redox reaction in which hydrogen reduces (donates its atoms as electrons and protons to) carbon dioxide. Robert Emerson discovered two light reactions by testing plant productivity using different wavelengths of light. With the red alone, the light reactions were suppressed. When blue and red were combined, the output was much more substantial. Thus, there were two photosystems, one absorbing up to 600 nm wavelengths, the other up to 700 nm. The former is known as PSII, the latter is PSI. PSI contains only chlorophyll \"a\", PSII contains primarily chlorophyll \"a\" with most of the available chlorophyll \"b\", among other pigments. These include phycobilins, which are the red and blue pigments of red and blue algae, respectively, and fucoxanthol for brown algae and diatoms. The process is most productive when the absorption of quanta is equal in both PSII and PSI, assuring that input energy from the antenna complex is divided between the PSI and PSII systems, which in turn powers the photochemistry.[11] Robert Hill thought that a complex of reactions consisted of an intermediate to cytochrome b6 (now a plastoquinone), and that another was from cytochrome f to a step in the carbohydrate-generating mechanisms. These are linked by plastoquinone, which does require energy to reduce cytochrome f. Further experiments to prove that the oxygen developed during the photosynthesis of green plants came from water were performed by Hill in 1937 and 1939. He showed that isolated chloroplasts give off oxygen in the presence of unnatural reducing agents like iron oxalate, ferricyanide or benzoquinone after exposure to light. In the Hill reaction:[92] 2 H2O + 2 A + (light, chloroplasts) → 2 AH2 + O2 A is the electron acceptor. Therefore, in light, the electron acceptor is reduced and oxygen is evolved. Samuel Ruben and Martin Kamen used radioactive isotopes to determine that the oxygen liberated in photosynthesis came from the water. Melvin Calvin works in his photosynthesis laboratory. Melvin Calvin and Andrew Benson, along with James Bassham, elucidated the path of carbon assimilation (the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle) in plants. The carbon reduction cycle is known as the Calvin cycle, but many scientists refer to it as the Calvin-Benson, Benson-Calvin, or even Calvin-Benson-Bassham (or CBB) Cycle. Nobel Prize–winning scientist Rudolph A. Marcus was later able to discover the function and significance of the electron transport chain. Otto Heinrich Warburg and Dean Burk discovered the I-quantum photosynthesis reaction that splits CO2, activated by the respiration.[93] In 1950, first experimental evidence for the existence of photophosphorylation in vivo was presented by Otto Kandler using intact Chlorella cells and interpreting his findings as light-dependent ATP formation.[94] In 1954, Daniel I. Arnon et al. discovered photophosphorylation in vitro in isolated chloroplasts with the help of P32.[95][96] Louis N. M. Duysens and Jan Amesz discovered that chlorophyll \"a\" will absorb one light, oxidize cytochrome f, while chlorophyll \"a\" (and other pigments) will absorb another light but will reduce this same oxidized cytochrome, stating the two light reactions are in series. Development of the concept In 1893, the American botanist Charles Reid Barnes proposed two terms, photosyntax and photosynthesis, for the biological process of synthesis of complex carbon compounds out of carbonic acid, in the presence of chlorophyll, under the influence of light. The term photosynthesis is derived from the Greek phōs (φῶς, gleam) and sýnthesis (σύνθεσις, arranging together),[97][98][99] while another word that he designated was photosyntax, from sýntaxis (σύνταξις, configuration). Over time, the term photosynthesis came into common usage. Later discovery of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria and photophosphorylation necessitated redefinition of the term.[100] C3 : C4 photosynthesis research In the late 1940s at the University of California, Berkeley, the details of photosynthetic carbon metabolism were sorted out by the chemists Melvin Calvin, Andrew Benson, James Bassham and a score of students and researchers utilizing the carbon-14 isotope and paper chromatography techniques.[101] The pathway of CO2 fixation by the algae Chlorella in a fraction of a second in light resulted in a three carbon molecule called phosphoglyceric acid (PGA). For that original and ground-breaking work, a Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Melvin Calvin in 1961. In parallel, plant physiologists studied leaf gas exchanges using the new method of infrared gas analysis and a leaf chamber where the net photosynthetic rates ranged from 10 to 13 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1, with the conclusion that all terrestrial plants have the same photosynthetic capacities, that are light saturated at less than 50% of sunlight.[102][103] Later in 1958–1963 at Cornell University, field grown maize was reported to have much greater leaf photosynthetic rates of 40 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1 and not be saturated at near full sunlight.[104][105] This higher rate in maize was almost double of those observed in other species such as wheat and soybean, indicating that large differences in photosynthesis exist among higher plants. At the University of Arizona, detailed gas exchange research on more than 15 species of monocots and dicots uncovered for the first time that differences in leaf anatomy are crucial factors in differentiating photosynthetic capacities among species.[106][107] In tropical grasses, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, Bermuda grass and in the dicot amaranthus, leaf photosynthetic rates were around 38−40 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1, and the leaves have two types of green cells, i.e. outer layer of mesophyll cells surrounding a tightly packed cholorophyllous vascular bundle sheath cells. This type of anatomy was termed Kranz anatomy in the 19th century by the botanist Gottlieb Haberlandt while studying leaf anatomy of sugarcane.[108] Plant species with the greatest photosynthetic rates and Kranz anatomy showed no apparent photorespiration, very low CO2 compensation point, high optimum temperature, high stomatal resistances and lower mesophyll resistances for gas diffusion and rates never saturated at full sun light.[109] The research at Arizona was designated a Citation Classic in 1986.[107] These species were later termed C4 plants as the first stable compound of CO2 fixation in light has four carbons as malate and aspartate.[110][111][112] Other species that lack Kranz anatomy were termed C3 type such as cotton and sunflower, as the first stable carbon compound is the three-carbon PGA. At 1000 ppm CO2 in measuring air, both the C3 and C4 plants had similar leaf photosynthetic rates around 60 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1 indicating the suppression of photorespiration in C3 plants.[106][107] Factors The leaf is the primary site of photosynthesis in plants. There are four main factors influencing photosynthesis and several corollary factors. The four main are:[113] Light irradiance and wavelength Water absorption Carbon dioxide concentration Temperature. Total photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors. These include the amount of light available, the amount of leaf area a plant has to capture light (shading by other plants is a major limitation of photosynthesis), the rate at which carbon dioxide can be supplied to the chloroplasts to support photosynthesis, the availability of water, and the availability of suitable temperatures for carrying out photosynthesis.[114] Light intensity (irradiance), wavelength and temperature See also: PI (photosynthesis-irradiance) curve Absorbance spectra of free chlorophyll a (blue) and b (red) in a solvent. The action spectra of chlorophyll molecules are slightly modified in vivo depending on specific pigment–protein interactions. The process of photosynthesis provides the main input of free energy into the biosphere, and is one of four main ways in which radiation is important for plant life.[115] The radiation climate within plant communities is extremely variable, in both time and space. In the early 20th century, Frederick Blackman and Gabrielle Matthaei investigated the effects of light intensity (irradiance) and temperature on the rate of carbon assimilation. At constant temperature, the rate of carbon assimilation varies with irradiance, increasing as the irradiance increases, but reaching a plateau at higher irradiance. At low irradiance, increasing the temperature has little influence on the rate of carbon assimilation. At constant high irradiance, the rate of carbon assimilation increases as the temperature is increased. These two experiments illustrate several important points: First, it is known that, in general, photochemical reactions are not affected by temperature. However, these experiments clearly show that temperature affects the rate of carbon assimilation, so there must be two sets of reactions in the full process of carbon assimilation. These are the light-dependent 'photochemical' temperature-independent stage, and the light-independent, temperature-dependent stage. Second, Blackman's experiments illustrate the concept of limiting factors. Another limiting factor is the wavelength of light. Cyanobacteria, which reside several meters underwater, cannot receive the correct wavelengths required to cause photoinduced charge separation in conventional photosynthetic pigments. To combat this problem, Cyanobacteria have a light-harvesting complex called Phycobilisome.[116] This complex is made up of a series of proteins with different pigments which surround the reaction center. Carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration Photorespiration As carbon dioxide concentrations rise, the rate at which sugars are made by the light-independent reactions increases until limited by other factors. RuBisCO, the enzyme that captures carbon dioxide in the light-independent reactions, has a binding affinity for both carbon dioxide and oxygen. When the concentration of carbon dioxide is high, RuBisCO will fix carbon dioxide. However, if the carbon dioxide concentration is low, RuBisCO will bind oxygen instead of carbon dioxide. This process, called photorespiration, uses energy, but does not produce sugars. RuBisCO oxygenase activity is disadvantageous to plants for several reasons: One product of oxygenase activity is phosphoglycolate (2 carbon) instead of 3-phosphoglycerate (3 carbon). Phosphoglycolate cannot be metabolized by the Calvin-Benson cycle and represents carbon lost from the cycle. A high oxygenase activity, therefore, drains the sugars that are required to recycle ribulose 5-bisphosphate and for the continuation of the Calvin-Benson cycle. Phosphoglycolate is quickly metabolized to glycolate that is toxic to a plant at a high concentration; it inhibits photosynthesis. Salvaging glycolate is an energetically expensive process that uses the glycolate pathway, and only 75% of the carbon is returned to the Calvin-Benson cycle as 3-phosphoglycerate. The reactions also produce ammonia (NH3), which is able to diffuse out of the plant, leading to a loss of nitrogen. A highly simplified summary is: 2 glycolate + ATP → 3-phosphoglycerate + carbon dioxide + ADP + NH3 The salvaging pathway for the products of RuBisCO oxygenase activity is more commonly known as photorespiration, since it is characterized by light-dependent oxygen consumption and the release of carbon dioxide.

These compounds are used to provide both the carbon skeletons for biosynthesis and the metabolic energy that drives cellular processes. It is believed that the first organisms on the primitive Earth had access to an abundance of the organic compounds produced by geochemical processes, but that most of these original compounds were used up billions of years ago. Since that time, the vast majority of the organic materials required by living cells have been produced by photosynthetic organisms, including many types of photosynthetic bacteria.The most advanced photosynthetic bacteria are the cyanobacteria, which have minimal nutrient requirements. They use electrons from water and the energy of sunlight when they convert atmospheric CO2 into organic compounds—a process called carbon fixation. In the course of splitting water [in the overall reaction nH2O + nCO2 (CH2O)n + nO2], they also liberate into the atmosphere the oxygen required for oxidative phosphorylation. As we see in this section, it is thought that the evolution of cyanobacteria from more primitive photosynthetic bacteria eventually made possible the development of abundant aerobic life forms.In plants and algae, which developed much later, photosynthesis occurs in a specialized intracellular organelle—the chloroplast. Chloroplasts perform photosynthesis during the daylight hours. The immediate products of photosynthesis, NADPH and ATP, are used by the photosynthetic cells to produce many organic molecules. In plants, the products include a low-molecular-weight sugar (usually sucrose) that is exported to meet the metabolic needs of the many nonphotosynthetic cells of the organism.Biochemical and genetic evidence strongly suggest that chloroplasts are descendants of oxygen-producing photosynthetic bacteria that were endocytosed and lived in symbiosis with primitive eucaryotic cells. Mitochondria are also generally believed to be descended from an endocytosed bacterium. The many differences between chloroplasts and mitochondria are thought to reflect their different bacterial ancestors, as well as their subsequent evolutionary divergence. Nevertheless, the fundamental mechanisms involved in light-driven ATP synthesis in chloroplasts are very similar to those that we have already discussed for respiration-driven ATP synthesis in mitochondria.The Chloroplast Is One Member of the Plastid Family of OrganellesChloroplasts are the most prominent members of the plastid family of organelles. Plastids are present in all living plant cells, each cell type having its own characteristic complement. All plastids share certain features. Most notably, all plastids in a particular plant species contain multiple copies of the same relatively small genome. In addition, each is enclosed by an envelope composed of two concentric membranes.As discussed in Chapter 12 (see Figure 12-3), all plastids develop from proplastids, small organelles in the immature cells of plant meristems (Figure 14-33A). Proplastids develop according to the requirements of each differentiated cell, and the type that is present is determined in large part by the nuclear genome. If a leaf is grown in darkness, its proplastids enlarge and develop into etioplasts, which have a semicrystalline array of internal membranes containing a yellow chlorophyll precursor instead of chlorophyll. When exposed to light, the etioplasts rapidly develop into chloroplasts by converting this precursor to chlorophyll and by synthesizing new membrane pigments, photosynthetic enzymes, and components of the electron-transport chain. Figure 14-33Plastid diversity. (A) A proplastid from a root tip cell of a bean plant. Note the double membrane; the inner membrane has also generated the relatively sparse internal membranes present. (B) Three amyloplasts (a form of leucoplast), or starch-storing (more...) Leucoplasts are plastids present in many epidermal and internal tissues that do not become green and photosynthetic. They are little more than enlarged proplastids. A common form of leucoplast is the amyloplast (Figure 14-33B), which accumulates the polysaccharide starch in storage tissues—a source of sugar for future use. In some plants, such as potatoes, the amyloplasts can grow to be as large as an average animal cell.It is important to realize that plastids are not just sites for photosynthesis and the deposition of storage materials. Plants have also used their plastids to compartmentalize their intermediary metabolism. Purine and pyrimidine synthesis, most amino acid synthesis, and all of the fatty acid synthesis of plants takes place in the plastids, whereas in animal cells these compounds are produced in the cytosol.Chloroplasts Resemble Mitochondria But Have an Extra CompartmentChloroplasts carry out their energy interconversions by chemiosmotic mechanisms in much the same way that mitochondria do. Although much larger (Figure 14-34A), they are organized on the same principles. They have a highly permeable outer membrane; a much less permeable inner membrane, in which membrane transport proteins are embedded; and a narrow intermembrane space in between. Together, these membranes form the chloroplast envelope (Figure 14-34B,C). The inner membrane surrounds a large space called the stroma, which is analogous to the mitochondrial matrix and contains many metabolic enzymes. Like the mitochondrion, the chloroplast has its own genome and genetic system. The stroma therefore also contains a special set of ribosomes, RNAs, and the chloroplast DNA. Figure 14-34Electron micrographs of chloroplasts. (A) In a wheat leaf cell, a thin rim of cytoplasm—containing chloroplasts, the nucleus, and mitochondria—surrounds a large vacuole. (B) A thin section of a single chloroplast, showing the chloroplast (more...)There is, however, an important difference between the organization of mitochondria and that of chloroplasts. The inner membrane of the chloroplast is not folded into cristae and does not contain electron-transport chains. Instead, the electron-transport chains, photosynthetic light-capturing systems, and ATP synthase are all contained in the thylakoid membrane, a third distinct membrane that forms a set of flattened disclike sacs, the thylakoids (Figure 14-35). The lumen of each thylakoid is thought to be connected with the lumen of other thylakoids, thereby defining a third internal compartment called the thylakoid space, which is separated by the thylakoid membrane from the stroma that surrounds it. Figure 14-35The chloroplast. This photosynthetic organelle contains three distinct membranes (the outer membrane, the inner membrane, and the thylakoid membrane) that define three separate internal compartments (the intermembrane space, the stroma, and the thylakoid (more...)The structural similarities and differences between mitochondria and chloroplasts are illustrated in Figure 14-36. The head of the chloroplast ATP synthase, where ATP is made, protrudes from the thylakoid membrane into the stroma, whereas it protrudes into the matrix from the inner mitochondrial membrane. Figure 14-36A mitochondrion and chloroplast compared. A chloroplast is generally much larger than a mitochondrion and contains, in addition to an outer and inner membrane, a thylakoid membrane enclosing a thylakoid space. Unlike the chloroplast inner membrane, the (more...)Chloroplasts Capture Energy from Sunlight and Use It to Fix CarbonThe many reactions that occur during photosynthesis in plants can be grouped into two broad categories: 1.In the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions (also called the “light reactions”), energy derived from sunlight energizes an electron in the green organic pigment chlorophyll, enabling the electron to move along an electron-transport chain in the thylakoid membrane in much the same way that an electron moves along the respiratory chain in mitochondria. The chlorophyll obtains its electrons from water (H2O), producing O2 as a by-product. During the electron-transport process, H+ is pumped across the thylakoid membrane, and the resulting electrochemical proton gradient drives the synthesis of ATP in the stroma. As the final step in this series of reactions, high-energy electrons are loaded (together with H+) onto NADP+, converting it to NADPH. All of these reactions are confined to the chloroplast.2.In the carbon-fixation reactions (also called the “dark reactions”), the ATP and the NADPH produced by the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions serve as the source of energy and reducing power, respectively, to drive the conversion of CO2 to carbohydrate. The carbon-fixation reactions, which begin in the chloroplast stroma and continue in the cytosol, produce sucrose and many other organic molecules in the leaves of the plant. The sucrose is exported to other tissues as a source of both organic molecules and energy for growth. Thus, the formation of ATP, NADPH, and O2 (which requires light energy directly) and the conversion of CO2 to carbohydrate (which requires light energy only indirectly) are separate processes (Figure 14-37), although elaborate feedback mechanisms interconnect the two. Several of the chloroplast enzymes required for carbon fixation, for example, are inactivated in the dark and reactivated by light-stimulated electron-transport processes. Figure 14-37The reactions of photosynthesis in a chloroplast. Water is oxidized and oxygen is released in the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions, while carbon dioxide is assimilated (fixed) to produce sugars and a variety of other organic molecules in the (more...)Carbon Fixation Is Catalyzed by Ribulose Bisphosphate CarboxylaseWe have seen earlier in this chapter how cells produce ATP by using the large amount of free energy released when carbohydrates are oxidized to CO2 and H2O. Clearly, therefore, the reverse reaction, in which CO2 and H2O combine to make carbohydrate, must be a very unfavorable one that can only occur if it is coupled to other, very favorable reactions that drive it.The central reaction of carbon fixation, in which an atom of inorganic carbon is converted to organic carbon, is illustrated in Figure 14-38: CO2 from the atmosphere combines with the five-carbon compound ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate plus water to yield two molecules of the three-carbon compound 3-phosphoglycerate. This “carbon-fixing” reaction, which was discovered in 1948, is catalyzed in the chloroplast stroma by a large enzyme called ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. Since each molecule of the complex works sluggishly (processing only about 3 molecules of substrate per second compared to 1000 molecules per second for a typical enzyme), many enzyme molecules are needed. Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase often constitutes more than 50% of the total chloroplast protein, and it is thought to be the most abundant protein on Earth. Figure 14-38The initial reaction in carbon fixation. This reaction, in which carbon dioxide is converted into organic carbon, is catalyzed in the chloroplast stroma by the abundant enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. The product is 3-phosphoglycerate, which (more...)Three Molecules of ATP and Two Molecules of NADPH Are Consumed for Each CO2 Molecule That Is FixedThe actual reaction in which CO2 is fixed is energetically favorable because of the reactivity of the energy-rich compound ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, to which each molecule of CO2 is added (see Figure 14-38). The elaborate metabolic pathway that produces ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate requires both NADPH and ATP; it was worked out in one of the first successful applications of radioisotopes as tracers in biochemistry. This carbon-fixation cycle (also called the Calvin cycle) is outlined in Figure 14-39. It starts when 3 molecules of CO2 are fixed by ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase to produce 6 molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (containing 6 × 3 = 18 carbon atoms in all: 3 from the CO2 and 15 from ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate). The 18 carbon atoms then undergo a cycle of reactions that regenerates the 3 molecules of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate used in the initial carbon-fixation step (containing 3 × 5 = 15 carbon atoms). This leaves 1 molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (3 carbon atoms) as the net gain. Figure 14-39The carbon-fixation cycle, which forms organic molecules from CO2 and H2O. The number of carbon atoms in each type of molecule is indicated in the white box. There are many intermediates between glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and ribulose 5-phosphate, but (more...)A total of 3 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of NADPH are consumed for each CO2 molecule converted into carbohydrate. The net equation is: Thus, both phosphate-bond energy (as ATP) and reducing power (as NADPH) are required for the formation of organic molecules from CO2 and H2O. We return to this important point later.The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced in chloroplasts by the carbon-fixation cycle is a three-carbon sugar that also serves as a central intermediate in glycolysis. Much of it is exported to the cytosol, where it can be converted into fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate by the reversal of several reactions in glycolysis (see Panel 2-8, pp. 124–125). The glucose 1-phosphate is then converted to the sugar nucleotide UDP-glucose, and this combines with the fructose 6-phosphate to form sucrose phosphate, the immediate precursor of the disaccharide sucrose. Sucrose is the major form in which sugar is transported between plant cells: just as glucose is transported in the blood of animals, sucrose is exported from the leaves via vascular bundles, providing the carbohydrate required by the rest of the plant.Most of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate that remains in the chloroplast is converted to starch in the stroma. Like glycogen in animal cells, starch is a large polymer of glucose that serves as a carbohydrate reserve (see Figure 14-33B). The production of starch is regulated so that it is produced and stored as large grains in the chloroplast stroma during periods of excess photosynthetic capacity. This occurs through reactions in the stroma that are the reverse of those in glycolysis: they convert glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to glucose 1-phosphate, which is then used to produce the sugar nucleotide ADP-glucose, the immediate precursor of starch. At night the starch is broken down to help support the metabolic needs of the plant. Starch provides an important part of the diet of all animals that eat plants.Carbon Fixation in Some Plants Is Compartmentalized to Facilitate Growth at Low CO2 ConcentrationsAlthough ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase preferentially adds CO2 to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, it can use O2 as a substrate in place of CO2, and if the concentration of CO2 is low, it will add O2 to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate instead (see Figure 14-38). This is the first step in a pathway called photorespiration, whose ultimate effect is to use up O2 and liberate CO2 without the production of useful energy stores. In many plants, about one-third of the CO2 fixed is lost again as CO2 because of photorespiration.Photorespiration can be a serious liability for plants in hot, dry conditions, which cause them to close their stomata (the gas exchange pores in their leaves) to avoid excessive water loss. This in turn causes the CO2 levels in the leaf to fall precipitously, thereby favoring photorespiration. A special adaptation, however, occurs in the leaves of many plants, such as corn and sugar cane that live in hot, dry environments. In these plants, the carbon-fixation cycle occurs only in the chloroplasts of specialized bundle-sheath cells, which contain all of the plant's ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. These cells are protected from the air and are surrounded by a specialized layer of mesophyll cells that use the energy harvested by their chloroplasts to “pump” CO2 into the bundle-sheath cells. This supplies the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase with a high concentration of CO2, thereby greatly reducing photorespiration.The CO2 pump is produced by a reaction cycle that begins in the cytosol of the mesophyll cells. A CO2-fixation step is catalyzed by an enzyme that binds carbon dioxide (as bicarbonate) and combines it with an activated three-carbon molecule to produce a four-carbon molecule. The four-carbon molecule diffuses into the bundle-sheath cells, where it is broken down to release the CO2 and generate a molecule with three carbons. The pumping cycle is completed when this three-carbon molecule is returned to the mesophyll cells and converted back to its original activated form. Because the CO2 is initially captured by converting it into a compound containing four carbons, the CO2-pumping plants are called C4 plants. All other plants are called C3 plants because they capture CO2 into the three-carbon compound 3-phosphoglycerate (Figure 14-40). Figure 14-40Comparative leaf anatomy in a C3 plant and a C4 plant. The cells with green cytosol in the leaf interior contain chloroplasts that perform the normal carbon-fixation cycle. In C4 plants, the mesophyll cells are specialized for CO2 pumping rather than (more...)As for any vectorial transport process, pumping CO2 into the bundle-sheath cells in C4 plants costs energy. In hot, dry environments, however, this cost can be much less than the energy lost by photorespiration in C3 plants, so C4 plants have a potential advantage. Moreover, because C4 plants can perform photosynthesis at a lower concentration of CO2 inside the leaf, they need to open their stomata less often and therefore can fix about twice as much net carbon as C3 plants per unit of water lost. Although the vast majority of plant species are C3 plants, C4 plants such as corn and sugar cane are much more effective at converting sunlight energy into biomass than C3 plants such as cereal grains. They are therefore of special importance in world agriculture.Photosynthesis Depends on the Photochemistry of Chlorophyll MoleculesHaving discussed the carbon-fixation reactions, we now return to the question of how the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions in the chloroplast generate the ATP and the NADPH needed to drive the production of carbohydrates from CO2 and H2O. The required energy is derived from sunlight absorbed by chlorophyll molecules (Figure 14-41). The process of energy conversion begins when a chlorophyll molecule is excited by a quantum of light (a photon) and an electron is moved from one molecular orbital to another of higher energy. As illustrated in Figure 14-42, such an excited molecule is unstable and tends to return to its original, unexcited state in one of three ways: Figure 14-41The structure of chlorophyll. A magnesium atom is held in a porphyrin ring, which is related to the porphyrin ring that binds iron in heme (see Figure 14-22). Electrons are delocalized over the bonds shown in blue. Figure 14-42Three ways for an excited chlorophyll molecule to return to its original, unexcited state. The light energy absorbed by an isolated chlorophyll molecule is completely released as light and heat by process 1. In photosynthesis, by contrast, chlorophylls (more...) 1.By converting the extra energy into heat (molecular motions) or to some combination of heat and light of a longer wavelength (fluorescence), which is what happens when light energy is absorbed by an isolated chlorophyll molecule in solution.2.By transferring the energy—but not the electron—directly to a neighboring chlorophyll molecule by a process called resonance energy transfer.3.By transferring the high-energy electron to another nearby molecule, an electron acceptor, and then returning to its original state by taking up a low-energy electron from some other molecule, an electron donor. The last two mechanisms are exploited in the process of photosynthesis.A Photosystem Consists of a Reaction Center Plus an Antenna ComplexMultiprotein complexes called photosystems catalyze the conversion of the light energy captured in excited chlorophyll molecules to useful forms. A photosystem consists of two closely linked components: an antenna complex, consisting of a large set of pigment molecules that capture light energy and feed it to the reaction center; and a photochemical reaction center, consisting of a complex of proteins and chlorophyll molecules that enable light energy to be converted into chemical energy (Figure 14-43). Figure 14-43The antenna complex and photochemical reaction center in a photosystem. The antenna complex is a collector of light energy in the form of excited electrons. The energy of the excited electrons is funneled, through a series of resonance energy transfers, (more...)The antenna complex is important for capturing light. In chloroplasts it consists of a number of distinct membrane protein complexes (known as light-harvesting complexes); together, these proteins bind several hundred chlorophyll molecules per reaction center, orienting them precisely in the thylakoid membrane. Depending on the plant, different amounts of accessory pigments called carotenoids, which protect the chlorophylls from oxidation and can help collect light of other wavelengths, are also located in each complex. When a chlorophyll molecule in the antenna complex is excited, the energy is rapidly transferred from one molecule to another by resonance energy transfer until it reaches a special pair of chlorophyll molecules in the photochemical reaction center. Each antenna complex thereby acts as a funnel, collecting light energy and directing it to a specific site where it can be used effectively (see Figure 14-43).The photochemical reaction center is a transmembrane protein-pigment complex that lies at the heart of photosynthesis. It is thought to have evolved more than 3 billion years ago in primitive photosynthetic bacteria. The special pair of chlorophyll molecules in the reaction center acts as an irreversible trap for excitation quanta because its excited electron is immediately passed to a chain of electron acceptors that are precisely positioned as neighbors in the same protein complex (Figure 14-44). By moving the high-energy electron rapidly away from the chlorophylls, the photochemical reaction center transfers it to an environment where it is much more stable. The electron is thereby suitably positioned for subsequent reactions, which require more time to complete. Figure 14-44The arrangement of the electron carriers in a bacterial photochemical reaction center, as determined by x-ray crystallography. The pigment molecules shown are held in the interior of a transmembrane protein and are surrounded by the lipid bilayer of the (more...)In a Reaction Center, Light Energy Captured by Chlorophyll Creates a Strong Electron Donor from a Weak OneThe electron transfers involved in the photochemical reactions just outlined have been analyzed extensively by rapid spectroscopic methods. An enormous amount of detailed information is available for the photosystem of purple bacteria, which is somewhat simpler than the evolutionarily related photosystems in chloroplasts. The reaction center in this photosystem is a large protein-pigment complex that can be solubilized with detergent and purified in active form. In 1985, its complete three-dimensional structure was determined by x-ray crystallography (see Figure 10-38). This structure, combined with kinetic data, provides the best picture we have of the initial electron-transfer reactions that underlie photosynthesis.The sequence of electron transfers that take place in the reaction center of purple bacteria is shown in Figure 14-45. As outlined previously for the general case (see Figure 14-43), light causes a net electron transfer from a weak electron donor (a molecule with a strong affinity for electrons) to a molecule that is a strong electron donor in its reduced form. The excitation energy in chlorophyll that would normally be released as fluorescence or heat is thereby used instead to create a strong electron donor (a molecule carrying a high-energy electron) where none had been before. In the purple bacterium, the weak electron donor used to fill the electron-deficient hole created by a light-induced charge separation is a cytochrome (see orange box in Figure 14-45); the strong electron donor produced is a quinone. In the chloroplasts of higher plants, a quinone is similarly produced. However, as we discuss next, water serves as the initial weak electron donor, which is why oxygen gas is released by photosynthesis in plants. Figure 14-45The electron transfers that occur in the photochemical reaction center of a purple bacterium. A similar set of reactions occurs in the evolutionarily related photosystem II in plants. At the top left is an orientating diagram showing the molecules that (more...)Noncyclic Photophosphorylation Produces Both NADPH and ATPPhotosynthesis in plants and cyanobacteria produces both ATP and NADPH directly by a two-step process called noncyclic photophosphorylation. Because two photosystems—called photosystems I and II—are used in series to energize an electron, the electron can be transferred all the way from water to NADPH. As the high-energy electrons pass through the coupled photosystems to generate NADPH, some of their energy is siphoned off for ATP synthesis.The first of the two photosystems—paradoxically called photosystem II for historical reasons—has the unique ability to withdraw electrons from water. The oxygens of two water molecules bind to a cluster of manganese atoms in a poorly understood water-splitting enzyme. This enzyme enables electrons to be removed one at a time from the water, as required to fill the electron-deficient holes created by light in chlorophyll molecules in the reaction center. As soon as four electrons have been removed from the two water molecules (requiring four quanta of light), O2 is released. Photosystem II thus catalyzes the reaction 2H2O + 4 photons → 4H+ + 4e - + O2. As we discussed for the electron-transport chain in mitochondria, which uses O2 and produces water, the mechanism ensures that no partly oxidized water molecules are released as dangerous, highly reactive oxygen radicals. Essentially all the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere has been produced in this way.The core of the reaction center in photosystem II is homologous to the bacterial reaction center just described, and it likewise produces strong electron donors in the form of reduced quinone molecules dissolved in the lipid bilayer of the membrane. The quinones pass their electrons to a H+ pump called the cytochrome b6-f complex, which resembles the cytochrome b-c1 complex in the respiratory chain of mitochondria. The cytochrome b6-f complex pumps H+ into the thylakoid space across the thylakoid membrane (or out of the cytosol across the plasma membrane in cyanobacteria), and the resulting electrochemical gradient drives the synthesis of ATP by an ATP synthase (Figure 14-46). Figure 14-46Electron flow during photosynthesis in the thylakoid membrane. The mobile electron carriers in the chain are plastoquinone (which closely resembles the ubiquinone of mitochondria), plastocyanin (a small copper-containing protein), and ferredoxin (a small (more...)The final electron acceptor in this electron-transport chain is the second photosystem, photosystem I, which accepts an electron into the electron-deficient hole created by light in the chlorophyll molecule in its reaction center. Each electron that enters photosystem I is finally boosted to a very high-energy level that allows it to be passed to the iron-sulfur center in ferredoxin and then to NADP+ to generate NADPH (Figure 14-47). Figure 14-47Changes in redox potential during photosynthesis. The redox potential for each molecule is indicated by its position along the vertical axis. In photosystem II, the excited reaction center chlorophyll has a redox potential high enough to withdraw electrons (more...)The scheme for photosynthesis just discussed is known as the Z scheme. By means of its two electron-energizing steps, one catalyzed by each photosystem, an electron is passed from water, which normally holds on to its electrons very tightly (redox potential = +820 mV), to NADPH, which normally holds on to its electrons loosely (redox potential = -320 mV). There is not enough energy in a single quantum of visible light to energize an electron all the way from the bottom of photosystem II to the top of photosystem I, which is presumably the energy change required to pass an electron efficiently from water to NADP+. The use of two separate photosystems in series means that the energy from two quanta of light is available for this purpose. In addition, there is enough energy left over to enable the electron-transport chain that links the two photosystems to pump H+ across the thylakoid membrane (or the plasma membrane of cyanobacteria), so that the ATP synthase can harness some of the light-derived energy for ATP production.Chloroplasts Can Make ATP by Cyclic Photophosphorylation Without Making NADPHIn the noncyclic photophosphorylation scheme just discussed, high-energy electrons leaving photosystem II are harnessed to generate ATP and are passed on to photosystem I to drive the production of NADPH. This produces slightly more than 1 molecule of ATP for every pair of electrons that passes from H2O to NADP+ to generate a molecule of NADPH. But 1.5 molecules of ATP per NADPH are needed for carbon fixation (see Figure 14-39). To produce extra ATP, the chloroplasts in some species of plants can switch photosystem I into a cyclic mode so that it produces ATP instead of NADPH. In this process, called cyclic photophosphorylation, the high-energy electrons from photosystem I are transferred to the cytochrome b6-f complex rather than being passed on to NADP+. From the b6-f complex, the electrons are passed back to photosystem I at a low energy. The only net result, besides the conversion of some light energy to heat, is that H+ is pumped across the thylakoid membrane by the b6-f complex as electrons pass through it, thereby increasing the electrochemical proton gradient that drives the ATP synthase. (This is analogous to the right side of the diagram for purple nonsulfur bacteria in Figure 14-71, below.) To summarize, cyclic photophosphorylation involves only photosystem I, and it produces ATP without the formation of either NADPH or O2. The relative activities of cyclic and noncyclic electron flows can be regulated by the cell to determine how much light energy is converted into reducing power (NADPH) and how much into high-energy phosphate bonds (ATP).Photosystems I and II Have Related Structures, and Also Resemble Bacterial PhotosystemsThe mechanisms of fundamental cell processes such as DNA replication or respiration generally turn out to be the same in eucaryotic cells and in bacteria, even though the number of protein components involved is considerably greater in eucaryotes. Eucaryotes evolved from procaryotes, and the additional proteins presumably were selected for during evolution because they provided an extra degree of efficiency and/or regulation that was useful to the cell.Photosystems provide a clear example of this type of evolution. Photosystem II, for example, is formed from more than 25 different protein subunits, creating a large assembly in the thylakoid membrane with a mass of about 1 million daltons. The atomic structures of the eucaryotic photosystems are being revealed by a combination of electron and x-ray crystallography. The task is difficult because the complexes are large and embedded in the lipid bilayer. Nevertheless, as illustrated in Figure 14-48, the close relationship of photosystem I, photosystem II, and the photochemical reaction center of purple bacteria has been clearly demonstrated from these atomic-level analyses. Figure 14-48Three types of photosynthetic reaction centers compared. Pigments involved in light harvesting are colored green; those involved in the central photochemical events are colored red. (A) The photochemical reaction center of purple bacteria, whose detailed (more...)The Proton-Motive Force Is the Same in Mitochondria and ChloroplastsThe presence of the thylakoid space separates a chloroplast into three rather than the two internal compartments of a mitochondrion. The net effect of H+ translocation in the two organelles is, however, similar. As illustrated in Figure 14-49, in chloroplasts, H+ is pumped out of the stroma (pH 8) into the thylakoid space (pH ~5), creating a gradient of 3–3.5 pH units. This represents a proton-motive force of about 200 mV across the thylakoid membrane, and it drives ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase embedded in this membrane. The force is the same as that across the inner mitochondrial membrane, but nearly all of it is contributed by the pH gradient rather than by a membrane potential, unlike the case in mitochondria. Figure 14-49A comparison of the flow of H+ and the orientation of the ATP synthase in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Those compartments with similar pH values have been colored the same. The proton-motive force across the thylakoid membrane consists almost entirely (more...)Like the stroma, the mitochondrial matrix has a pH of about 8. This is created by pumping H+ out of the mitochondrion into the cytosol (pH ~7) rather than into an interior space in the organelle. Thus, the pH gradient is relatively small, and most of the proton-motive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane is instead caused by the resulting membrane potential (see Figure 14-13).For both mitochondria and chloroplasts, the catalytic site of the ATP synthase is at a pH of about 8 and is located in a large organelle compartment (matrix or stroma) that is packed full of soluble enzymes. Consequently, it is here that all of the organelle's ATP is made (see Figure 14-49).Carrier Proteins in the Chloroplast Inner Membrane Control Metabolite Exchange with the CytosolIf chloroplasts are isolated in a way that leaves their inner membrane intact, this membrane can be shown to have a selective permeability, reflecting the presence of specific carrier proteins. Most notably, much of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced by CO2 fixation in the chloroplast stroma is transported out of the chloroplast by an efficient antiport system that exchanges three-carbon sugar phosphates for an inward flux of inorganic phosphate.Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate normally provides the cytosol with an abundant source of carbohydrate, which is used by the cell as the starting point for many other biosyntheses—including the production of sucrose for export. But this is not all that this molecule provides. Once the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate reaches the cytosol, it is readily converted (by part of the glycolytic pathway) to 1,3-phosphoglycerate and then 3-phosphoglycerate (see p. 97), generating one molecule of ATP and one of NADH. (A similar two-step reaction, but working in reverse, forms glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the carbon-fixation cycle; see Figure 14-39.) As a result, the export of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate from the chloroplast provides not only the main source of fixed carbon to the rest of the cell, but also the reducing power and ATP needed for metabolism outside the chloroplast.Chloroplasts Also Perform Other Crucial BiosynthesesThe chloroplast performs many biosyntheses in addition to photosynthesis. All of the cell's fatty acids and a number of amino acids, for example, are made by enzymes in the chloroplast stroma. Similarly, the reducing power of light-activated electrons drives the reduction of nitrite (NO2-) to ammonia (NH3) in the chloroplast; this ammonia provides the plant with nitrogen for the synthesis of amino acids and nucleotides. The metabolic importance of the chloroplast for plants and algae therefore extends far beyond its role in photosynthesis.SummaryChloroplasts and photosynthetic bacteria obtain high-energy electrons by means of photosystems that capture the electrons that are excited when sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules. Photosystems are composed of an antenna complex that funnels energy to a photochemical reaction center, where a precisely ordered complex of proteins and pigments allows the energy of an excited electron in chlorophyll to be captured by electron carriers. The best-understood photochemical reaction center is that of purple photosynthetic bacteria, which contain only a single photosystem. In contrast, there are two distinct photosystems in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. The two photosystems are normally linked in series, and they transfer electrons from water to NADP+ to form NADPH, with the concomitant production of a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient. In these linked photosystems, molecular oxygen (O2) is generated as a by-product of removing four low-energy electrons from two specifically positioned water molecules.Compared with mitochondria, chloroplasts have an additional internal membrane (the thylakoid membrane) and a third internal space (the thylakoid space). All electron-transport processes occur in the thylakoid membrane: to make ATP, H+ is pumped into the thylakoid space, and a backflow of H+ through an ATP synthase then produces the ATP in the chloroplast stroma. This ATP is used in conjunction with the NADPH made by photosynthesis to drive a large number of biosynthetic reactions in the chloroplast stroma, including the all-important carbon-fixation cycle, which creates carbohydrate from CO2. Along with some other important chloroplast products, this carbohydrate is exported to the cell cytosol, where—as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate—it provides organic carbon, ATP, and reducing power to the rest of the cell.

These compounds are used to provide both the carbon skeletons for biosynthesis and the metabolic energy that drives cellular processes. It is believed that the first organisms on the primitive Earth had access to an abundance of the organic compounds produced by geochemical processes, but that most of these original compounds were used up billions of years ago. Since that time, the vast majority of the organic materials required by living cells have been produced by photosynthetic organisms, including many types of photosynthetic bacteria.The most advanced photosynthetic bacteria are the cyanobacteria, which have minimal nutrient requirements. They use electrons from water and the energy of sunlight when they convert atmospheric CO2 into organic compounds—a process called carbon fixation. In the course of splitting water [in the overall reaction nH2O + nCO2 (CH2O)n + nO2], they also liberate into the atmosphere the oxygen required for oxidative phosphorylation. As we see in this section, it is thought that the evolution of cyanobacteria from more primitive photosynthetic bacteria eventually made possible the development of abundant aerobic life forms.In plants and algae, which developed much later, photosynthesis occurs in a specialized intracellular organelle—the chloroplast. Chloroplasts perform photosynthesis during the daylight hours. The immediate products of photosynthesis, NADPH and ATP, are used by the photosynthetic cells to produce many organic molecules. In plants, the products include a low-molecular-weight sugar (usually sucrose) that is exported to meet the metabolic needs of the many nonphotosynthetic cells of the organism.Biochemical and genetic evidence strongly suggest that chloroplasts are descendants of oxygen-producing photosynthetic bacteria that were endocytosed and lived in symbiosis with primitive eucaryotic cells. Mitochondria are also generally believed to be descended from an endocytosed bacterium. The many differences between chloroplasts and mitochondria are thought to reflect their different bacterial ancestors, as well as their subsequent evolutionary divergence. Nevertheless, the fundamental mechanisms involved in light-driven ATP synthesis in chloroplasts are very similar to those that we have already discussed for respiration-driven ATP synthesis in mitochondria.The Chloroplast Is One Member of the Plastid Family of OrganellesChloroplasts are the most prominent members of the plastid family of organelles. Plastids are present in all living plant cells, each cell type having its own characteristic complement. All plastids share certain features. Most notably, all plastids in a particular plant species contain multiple copies of the same relatively small genome. In addition, each is enclosed by an envelope composed of two concentric membranes.As discussed in Chapter 12 (see Figure 12-3), all plastids develop from proplastids, small organelles in the immature cells of plant meristems (Figure 14-33A). Proplastids develop according to the requirements of each differentiated cell, and the type that is present is determined in large part by the nuclear genome. If a leaf is grown in darkness, its proplastids enlarge and develop into etioplasts, which have a semicrystalline array of internal membranes containing a yellow chlorophyll precursor instead of chlorophyll. When exposed to light, the etioplasts rapidly develop into chloroplasts by converting this precursor to chlorophyll and by synthesizing new membrane pigments, photosynthetic enzymes, and components of the electron-transport chain. Figure 14-33Plastid diversity. (A) A proplastid from a root tip cell of a bean plant. Note the double membrane; the inner membrane has also generated the relatively sparse internal membranes present. (B) Three amyloplasts (a form of leucoplast), or starch-storing (more...) Leucoplasts are plastids present in many epidermal and internal tissues that do not become green and photosynthetic. They are little more than enlarged proplastids. A common form of leucoplast is the amyloplast (Figure 14-33B), which accumulates the polysaccharide starch in storage tissues—a source of sugar for future use. In some plants, such as potatoes, the amyloplasts can grow to be as large as an average animal cell.It is important to realize that plastids are not just sites for photosynthesis and the deposition of storage materials. Plants have also used their plastids to compartmentalize their intermediary metabolism. Purine and pyrimidine synthesis, most amino acid synthesis, and all of the fatty acid synthesis of plants takes place in the plastids, whereas in animal cells these compounds are produced in the cytosol.Chloroplasts Resemble Mitochondria But Have an Extra CompartmentChloroplasts carry out their energy interconversions by chemiosmotic mechanisms in much the same way that mitochondria do. Although much larger (Figure 14-34A), they are organized on the same principles. They have a highly permeable outer membrane; a much less permeable inner membrane, in which membrane transport proteins are embedded; and a narrow intermembrane space in between. Together, these membranes form the chloroplast envelope (Figure 14-34B,C). The inner membrane surrounds a large space called the stroma, which is analogous to the mitochondrial matrix and contains many metabolic enzymes. Like the mitochondrion, the chloroplast has its own genome and genetic system. The stroma therefore also contains a special set of ribosomes, RNAs, and the chloroplast DNA. Figure 14-34Electron micrographs of chloroplasts. (A) In a wheat leaf cell, a thin rim of cytoplasm—containing chloroplasts, the nucleus, and mitochondria—surrounds a large vacuole. (B) A thin section of a single chloroplast, showing the chloroplast (more...)There is, however, an important difference between the organization of mitochondria and that of chloroplasts. The inner membrane of the chloroplast is not folded into cristae and does not contain electron-transport chains. Instead, the electron-transport chains, photosynthetic light-capturing systems, and ATP synthase are all contained in the thylakoid membrane, a third distinct membrane that forms a set of flattened disclike sacs, the thylakoids (Figure 14-35). The lumen of each thylakoid is thought to be connected with the lumen of other thylakoids, thereby defining a third internal compartment called the thylakoid space, which is separated by the thylakoid membrane from the stroma that surrounds it. Figure 14-35The chloroplast. This photosynthetic organelle contains three distinct membranes (the outer membrane, the inner membrane, and the thylakoid membrane) that define three separate internal compartments (the intermembrane space, the stroma, and the thylakoid (more...)The structural similarities and differences between mitochondria and chloroplasts are illustrated in Figure 14-36. The head of the chloroplast ATP synthase, where ATP is made, protrudes from the thylakoid membrane into the stroma, whereas it protrudes into the matrix from the inner mitochondrial membrane. Figure 14-36A mitochondrion and chloroplast compared. A chloroplast is generally much larger than a mitochondrion and contains, in addition to an outer and inner membrane, a thylakoid membrane enclosing a thylakoid space. Unlike the chloroplast inner membrane, the (more...)Chloroplasts Capture Energy from Sunlight and Use It to Fix CarbonThe many reactions that occur during photosynthesis in plants can be grouped into two broad categories: 1.In the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions (also called the “light reactions”), energy derived from sunlight energizes an electron in the green organic pigment chlorophyll, enabling the electron to move along an electron-transport chain in the thylakoid membrane in much the same way that an electron moves along the respiratory chain in mitochondria. The chlorophyll obtains its electrons from water (H2O), producing O2 as a by-product. During the electron-transport process, H+ is pumped across the thylakoid membrane, and the resulting electrochemical proton gradient drives the synthesis of ATP in the stroma. As the final step in this series of reactions, high-energy electrons are loaded (together with H+) onto NADP+, converting it to NADPH. All of these reactions are confined to the chloroplast.2.In the carbon-fixation reactions (also called the “dark reactions”), the ATP and the NADPH produced by the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions serve as the source of energy and reducing power, respectively, to drive the conversion of CO2 to carbohydrate. The carbon-fixation reactions, which begin in the chloroplast stroma and continue in the cytosol, produce sucrose and many other organic molecules in the leaves of the plant. The sucrose is exported to other tissues as a source of both organic molecules and energy for growth. Thus, the formation of ATP, NADPH, and O2 (which requires light energy directly) and the conversion of CO2 to carbohydrate (which requires light energy only indirectly) are separate processes (Figure 14-37), although elaborate feedback mechanisms interconnect the two. Several of the chloroplast enzymes required for carbon fixation, for example, are inactivated in the dark and reactivated by light-stimulated electron-transport processes. Figure 14-37The reactions of photosynthesis in a chloroplast. Water is oxidized and oxygen is released in the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions, while carbon dioxide is assimilated (fixed) to produce sugars and a variety of other organic molecules in the (more...)Carbon Fixation Is Catalyzed by Ribulose Bisphosphate CarboxylaseWe have seen earlier in this chapter how cells produce ATP by using the large amount of free energy released when carbohydrates are oxidized to CO2 and H2O. Clearly, therefore, the reverse reaction, in which CO2 and H2O combine to make carbohydrate, must be a very unfavorable one that can only occur if it is coupled to other, very favorable reactions that drive it.The central reaction of carbon fixation, in which an atom of inorganic carbon is converted to organic carbon, is illustrated in Figure 14-38: CO2 from the atmosphere combines with the five-carbon compound ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate plus water to yield two molecules of the three-carbon compound 3-phosphoglycerate. This “carbon-fixing” reaction, which was discovered in 1948, is catalyzed in the chloroplast stroma by a large enzyme called ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. Since each molecule of the complex works sluggishly (processing only about 3 molecules of substrate per second compared to 1000 molecules per second for a typical enzyme), many enzyme molecules are needed. Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase often constitutes more than 50% of the total chloroplast protein, and it is thought to be the most abundant protein on Earth. Figure 14-38The initial reaction in carbon fixation. This reaction, in which carbon dioxide is converted into organic carbon, is catalyzed in the chloroplast stroma by the abundant enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. The product is 3-phosphoglycerate, which (more...)Three Molecules of ATP and Two Molecules of NADPH Are Consumed for Each CO2 Molecule That Is FixedThe actual reaction in which CO2 is fixed is energetically favorable because of the reactivity of the energy-rich compound ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, to which each molecule of CO2 is added (see Figure 14-38). The elaborate metabolic pathway that produces ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate requires both NADPH and ATP; it was worked out in one of the first successful applications of radioisotopes as tracers in biochemistry. This carbon-fixation cycle (also called the Calvin cycle) is outlined in Figure 14-39. It starts when 3 molecules of CO2 are fixed by ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase to produce 6 molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (containing 6 × 3 = 18 carbon atoms in all: 3 from the CO2 and 15 from ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate). The 18 carbon atoms then undergo a cycle of reactions that regenerates the 3 molecules of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate used in the initial carbon-fixation step (containing 3 × 5 = 15 carbon atoms). This leaves 1 molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (3 carbon atoms) as the net gain. Figure 14-39The carbon-fixation cycle, which forms organic molecules from CO2 and H2O. The number of carbon atoms in each type of molecule is indicated in the white box. There are many intermediates between glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and ribulose 5-phosphate, but (more...)A total of 3 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of NADPH are consumed for each CO2 molecule converted into carbohydrate. The net equation is: Thus, both phosphate-bond energy (as ATP) and reducing power (as NADPH) are required for the formation of organic molecules from CO2 and H2O. We return to this important point later.The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced in chloroplasts by the carbon-fixation cycle is a three-carbon sugar that also serves as a central intermediate in glycolysis. Much of it is exported to the cytosol, where it can be converted into fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate by the reversal of several reactions in glycolysis (see Panel 2-8, pp. 124–125). The glucose 1-phosphate is then converted to the sugar nucleotide UDP-glucose, and this combines with the fructose 6-phosphate to form sucrose phosphate, the immediate precursor of the disaccharide sucrose. Sucrose is the major form in which sugar is transported between plant cells: just as glucose is transported in the blood of animals, sucrose is exported from the leaves via vascular bundles, providing the carbohydrate required by the rest of the plant.Most of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate that remains in the chloroplast is converted to starch in the stroma. Like glycogen in animal cells, starch is a large polymer of glucose that serves as a carbohydrate reserve (see Figure 14-33B). The production of starch is regulated so that it is produced and stored as large grains in the chloroplast stroma during periods of excess photosynthetic capacity. This occurs through reactions in the stroma that are the reverse of those in glycolysis: they convert glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to glucose 1-phosphate, which is then used to produce the sugar nucleotide ADP-glucose, the immediate precursor of starch. At night the starch is broken down to help support the metabolic needs of the plant. Starch provides an important part of the diet of all animals that eat plants.Carbon Fixation in Some Plants Is Compartmentalized to Facilitate Growth at Low CO2 ConcentrationsAlthough ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase preferentially adds CO2 to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, it can use O2 as a substrate in place of CO2, and if the concentration of CO2 is low, it will add O2 to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate instead (see Figure 14-38). This is the first step in a pathway called photorespiration, whose ultimate effect is to use up O2 and liberate CO2 without the production of useful energy stores. In many plants, about one-third of the CO2 fixed is lost again as CO2 because of photorespiration.Photorespiration can be a serious liability for plants in hot, dry conditions, which cause them to close their stomata (the gas exchange pores in their leaves) to avoid excessive water loss. This in turn causes the CO2 levels in the leaf to fall precipitously, thereby favoring photorespiration. A special adaptation, however, occurs in the leaves of many plants, such as corn and sugar cane that live in hot, dry environments. In these plants, the carbon-fixation cycle occurs only in the chloroplasts of specialized bundle-sheath cells, which contain all of the plant's ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. These cells are protected from the air and are surrounded by a specialized layer of mesophyll cells that use the energy harvested by their chloroplasts to “pump” CO2 into the bundle-sheath cells. This supplies the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase with a high concentration of CO2, thereby greatly reducing photorespiration.The CO2 pump is produced by a reaction cycle that begins in the cytosol of the mesophyll cells. A CO2-fixation step is catalyzed by an enzyme that binds carbon dioxide (as bicarbonate) and combines it with an activated three-carbon molecule to produce a four-carbon molecule. The four-carbon molecule diffuses into the bundle-sheath cells, where it is broken down to release the CO2 and generate a molecule with three carbons. The pumping cycle is completed when this three-carbon molecule is returned to the mesophyll cells and converted back to its original activated form. Because the CO2 is initially captured by converting it into a compound containing four carbons, the CO2-pumping plants are called C4 plants. All other plants are called C3 plants because they capture CO2 into the three-carbon compound 3-phosphoglycerate (Figure 14-40). Figure 14-40Comparative leaf anatomy in a C3 plant and a C4 plant. The cells with green cytosol in the leaf interior contain chloroplasts that perform the normal carbon-fixation cycle. In C4 plants, the mesophyll cells are specialized for CO2 pumping rather than (more...)As for any vectorial transport process, pumping CO2 into the bundle-sheath cells in C4 plants costs energy. In hot, dry environments, however, this cost can be much less than the energy lost by photorespiration in C3 plants, so C4 plants have a potential advantage. Moreover, because C4 plants can perform photosynthesis at a lower concentration of CO2 inside the leaf, they need to open their stomata less often and therefore can fix about twice as much net carbon as C3 plants per unit of water lost. Although the vast majority of plant species are C3 plants, C4 plants such as corn and sugar cane are much more effective at converting sunlight energy into biomass than C3 plants such as cereal grains. They are therefore of special importance in world agriculture.Photosynthesis Depends on the Photochemistry of Chlorophyll MoleculesHaving discussed the carbon-fixation reactions, we now return to the question of how the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions in the chloroplast generate the ATP and the NADPH needed to drive the production of carbohydrates from CO2 and H2O. The required energy is derived from sunlight absorbed by chlorophyll molecules (Figure 14-41). The process of energy conversion begins when a chlorophyll molecule is excited by a quantum of light (a photon) and an electron is moved from one molecular orbital to another of higher energy. As illustrated in Figure 14-42, such an excited molecule is unstable and tends to return to its original, unexcited state in one of three ways: Figure 14-41The structure of chlorophyll. A magnesium atom is held in a porphyrin ring, which is related to the porphyrin ring that binds iron in heme (see Figure 14-22). Electrons are delocalized over the bonds shown in blue. Figure 14-42Three ways for an excited chlorophyll molecule to return to its original, unexcited state. The light energy absorbed by an isolated chlorophyll molecule is completely released as light and heat by process 1. In photosynthesis, by contrast, chlorophylls (more...) 1.By converting the extra energy into heat (molecular motions) or to some combination of heat and light of a longer wavelength (fluorescence), which is what happens when light energy is absorbed by an isolated chlorophyll molecule in solution.2.By transferring the energy—but not the electron—directly to a neighboring chlorophyll molecule by a process called resonance energy transfer.3.By transferring the high-energy electron to another nearby molecule, an electron acceptor, and then returning to its original state by taking up a low-energy electron from some other molecule, an electron donor. The last two mechanisms are exploited in the process of photosynthesis.A Photosystem Consists of a Reaction Center Plus an Antenna ComplexMultiprotein complexes called photosystems catalyze the conversion of the light energy captured in excited chlorophyll molecules to useful forms. A photosystem consists of two closely linked components: an antenna complex, consisting of a large set of pigment molecules that capture light energy and feed it to the reaction center; and a photochemical reaction center, consisting of a complex of proteins and chlorophyll molecules that enable light energy to be converted into chemical energy (Figure 14-43). Figure 14-43The antenna complex and photochemical reaction center in a photosystem. The antenna complex is a collector of light energy in the form of excited electrons. The energy of the excited electrons is funneled, through a series of resonance energy transfers, (more...)The antenna complex is important for capturing light. In chloroplasts it consists of a number of distinct membrane protein complexes (known as light-harvesting complexes); together, these proteins bind several hundred chlorophyll molecules per reaction center, orienting them precisely in the thylakoid membrane. Depending on the plant, different amounts of accessory pigments called carotenoids, which protect the chlorophylls from oxidation and can help collect light of other wavelengths, are also located in each complex. When a chlorophyll molecule in the antenna complex is excited, the energy is rapidly transferred from one molecule to another by resonance energy transfer until it reaches a special pair of chlorophyll molecules in the photochemical reaction center. Each antenna complex thereby acts as a funnel, collecting light energy and directing it to a specific site where it can be used effectively (see Figure 14-43).The photochemical reaction center is a transmembrane protein-pigment complex that lies at the heart of photosynthesis. It is thought to have evolved more than 3 billion years ago in primitive photosynthetic bacteria. The special pair of chlorophyll molecules in the reaction center acts as an irreversible trap for excitation quanta because its excited electron is immediately passed to a chain of electron acceptors that are precisely positioned as neighbors in the same protein complex (Figure 14-44). By moving the high-energy electron rapidly away from the chlorophylls, the photochemical reaction center transfers it to an environment where it is much more stable. The electron is thereby suitably positioned for subsequent reactions, which require more time to complete. Figure 14-44The arrangement of the electron carriers in a bacterial photochemical reaction center, as determined by x-ray crystallography. The pigment molecules shown are held in the interior of a transmembrane protein and are surrounded by the lipid bilayer of the (more...)In a Reaction Center, Light Energy Captured by Chlorophyll Creates a Strong Electron Donor from a Weak OneThe electron transfers involved in the photochemical reactions just outlined have been analyzed extensively by rapid spectroscopic methods. An enormous amount of detailed information is available for the photosystem of purple bacteria, which is somewhat simpler than the evolutionarily related photosystems in chloroplasts. The reaction center in this photosystem is a large protein-pigment complex that can be solubilized with detergent and purified in active form. In 1985, its complete three-dimensional structure was determined by x-ray crystallography (see Figure 10-38). This structure, combined with kinetic data, provides the best picture we have of the initial electron-transfer reactions that underlie photosynthesis.The sequence of electron transfers that take place in the reaction center of purple bacteria is shown in Figure 14-45. As outlined previously for the general case (see Figure 14-43), light causes a net electron transfer from a weak electron donor (a molecule with a strong affinity for electrons) to a molecule that is a strong electron donor in its reduced form. The excitation energy in chlorophyll that would normally be released as fluorescence or heat is thereby used instead to create a strong electron donor (a molecule carrying a high-energy electron) where none had been before. In the purple bacterium, the weak electron donor used to fill the electron-deficient hole created by a light-induced charge separation is a cytochrome (see orange box in Figure 14-45); the strong electron donor produced is a quinone. In the chloroplasts of higher plants, a quinone is similarly produced. However, as we discuss next, water serves as the initial weak electron donor, which is why oxygen gas is released by photosynthesis in plants. Figure 14-45The electron transfers that occur in the photochemical reaction center of a purple bacterium. A similar set of reactions occurs in the evolutionarily related photosystem II in plants. At the top left is an orientating diagram showing the molecules that (more...)Noncyclic Photophosphorylation Produces Both NADPH and ATPPhotosynthesis in plants and cyanobacteria produces both ATP and NADPH directly by a two-step process called noncyclic photophosphorylation. Because two photosystems—called photosystems I and II—are used in series to energize an electron, the electron can be transferred all the way from water to NADPH. As the high-energy electrons pass through the coupled photosystems to generate NADPH, some of their energy is siphoned off for ATP synthesis.The first of the two photosystems—paradoxically called photosystem II for historical reasons—has the unique ability to withdraw electrons from water. The oxygens of two water molecules bind to a cluster of manganese atoms in a poorly understood water-splitting enzyme. This enzyme enables electrons to be removed one at a time from the water, as required to fill the electron-deficient holes created by light in chlorophyll molecules in the reaction center. As soon as four electrons have been removed from the two water molecules (requiring four quanta of light), O2 is released. Photosystem II thus catalyzes the reaction 2H2O + 4 photons → 4H+ + 4e - + O2. As we discussed for the electron-transport chain in mitochondria, which uses O2 and produces water, the mechanism ensures that no partly oxidized water molecules are released as dangerous, highly reactive oxygen radicals. Essentially all the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere has been produced in this way.The core of the reaction center in photosystem II is homologous to the bacterial reaction center just described, and it likewise produces strong electron donors in the form of reduced quinone molecules dissolved in the lipid bilayer of the membrane. The quinones pass their electrons to a H+ pump called the cytochrome b6-f complex, which resembles the cytochrome b-c1 complex in the respiratory chain of mitochondria. The cytochrome b6-f complex pumps H+ into the thylakoid space across the thylakoid membrane (or out of the cytosol across the plasma membrane in cyanobacteria), and the resulting electrochemical gradient drives the synthesis of ATP by an ATP synthase (Figure 14-46). Figure 14-46Electron flow during photosynthesis in the thylakoid membrane. The mobile electron carriers in the chain are plastoquinone (which closely resembles the ubiquinone of mitochondria), plastocyanin (a small copper-containing protein), and ferredoxin (a small (more...)The final electron acceptor in this electron-transport chain is the second photosystem, photosystem I, which accepts an electron into the electron-deficient hole created by light in the chlorophyll molecule in its reaction center. Each electron that enters photosystem I is finally boosted to a very high-energy level that allows it to be passed to the iron-sulfur center in ferredoxin and then to NADP+ to generate NADPH (Figure 14-47). Figure 14-47Changes in redox potential during photosynthesis. The redox potential for each molecule is indicated by its position along the vertical axis. In photosystem II, the excited reaction center chlorophyll has a redox potential high enough to withdraw electrons (more...)The scheme for photosynthesis just discussed is known as the Z scheme. By means of its two electron-energizing steps, one catalyzed by each photosystem, an electron is passed from water, which normally holds on to its electrons very tightly (redox potential = +820 mV), to NADPH, which normally holds on to its electrons loosely (redox potential = -320 mV). There is not enough energy in a single quantum of visible light to energize an electron all the way from the bottom of photosystem II to the top of photosystem I, which is presumably the energy change required to pass an electron efficiently from water to NADP+. The use of two separate photosystems in series means that the energy from two quanta of light is available for this purpose. In addition, there is enough energy left over to enable the electron-transport chain that links the two photosystems to pump H+ across the thylakoid membrane (or the plasma membrane of cyanobacteria), so that the ATP synthase can harness some of the light-derived energy for ATP production.Chloroplasts Can Make ATP by Cyclic Photophosphorylation Without Making NADPHIn the noncyclic photophosphorylation scheme just discussed, high-energy electrons leaving photosystem II are harnessed to generate ATP and are passed on to photosystem I to drive the production of NADPH. This produces slightly more than 1 molecule of ATP for every pair of electrons that passes from H2O to NADP+ to generate a molecule of NADPH. But 1.5 molecules of ATP per NADPH are needed for carbon fixation (see Figure 14-39). To produce extra ATP, the chloroplasts in some species of plants can switch photosystem I into a cyclic mode so that it produces ATP instead of NADPH. In this process, called cyclic photophosphorylation, the high-energy electrons from photosystem I are transferred to the cytochrome b6-f complex rather than being passed on to NADP+. From the b6-f complex, the electrons are passed back to photosystem I at a low energy. The only net result, besides the conversion of some light energy to heat, is that H+ is pumped across the thylakoid membrane by the b6-f complex as electrons pass through it, thereby increasing the electrochemical proton gradient that drives the ATP synthase. (This is analogous to the right side of the diagram for purple nonsulfur bacteria in Figure 14-71, below.) To summarize, cyclic photophosphorylation involves only photosystem I, and it produces ATP without the formation of either NADPH or O2. The relative activities of cyclic and noncyclic electron flows can be regulated by the cell to determine how much light energy is converted into reducing power (NADPH) and how much into high-energy phosphate bonds (ATP).Photosystems I and II Have Related Structures, and Also Resemble Bacterial PhotosystemsThe mechanisms of fundamental cell processes such as DNA replication or respiration generally turn out to be the same in eucaryotic cells and in bacteria, even though the number of protein components involved is considerably greater in eucaryotes. Eucaryotes evolved from procaryotes, and the additional proteins presumably were selected for during evolution because they provided an extra degree of efficiency and/or regulation that was useful to the cell.Photosystems provide a clear example of this type of evolution. Photosystem II, for example, is formed from more than 25 different protein subunits, creating a large assembly in the thylakoid membrane with a mass of about 1 million daltons. The atomic structures of the eucaryotic photosystems are being revealed by a combination of electron and x-ray crystallography. The task is difficult because the complexes are large and embedded in the lipid bilayer. Nevertheless, as illustrated in Figure 14-48, the close relationship of photosystem I, photosystem II, and the photochemical reaction center of purple bacteria has been clearly demonstrated from these atomic-level analyses. Figure 14-48Three types of photosynthetic reaction centers compared. Pigments involved in light harvesting are colored green; those involved in the central photochemical events are colored red. (A) The photochemical reaction center of purple bacteria, whose detailed (more...)The Proton-Motive Force Is the Same in Mitochondria and ChloroplastsThe presence of the thylakoid space separates a chloroplast into three rather than the two internal compartments of a mitochondrion. The net effect of H+ translocation in the two organelles is, however, similar. As illustrated in Figure 14-49, in chloroplasts, H+ is pumped out of the stroma (pH 8) into the thylakoid space (pH ~5), creating a gradient of 3–3.5 pH units. This represents a proton-motive force of about 200 mV across the thylakoid membrane, and it drives ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase embedded in this membrane. The force is the same as that across the inner mitochondrial membrane, but nearly all of it is contributed by the pH gradient rather than by a membrane potential, unlike the case in mitochondria. Figure 14-49A comparison of the flow of H+ and the orientation of the ATP synthase in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Those compartments with similar pH values have been colored the same. The proton-motive force across the thylakoid membrane consists almost entirely (more...)Like the stroma, the mitochondrial matrix has a pH of about 8. This is created by pumping H+ out of the mitochondrion into the cytosol (pH ~7) rather than into an interior space in the organelle. Thus, the pH gradient is relatively small, and most of the proton-motive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane is instead caused by the resulting membrane potential (see Figure 14-13).For both mitochondria and chloroplasts, the catalytic site of the ATP synthase is at a pH of about 8 and is located in a large organelle compartment (matrix or stroma) that is packed full of soluble enzymes. Consequently, it is here that all of the organelle's ATP is made (see Figure 14-49).Carrier Proteins in the Chloroplast Inner Membrane Control Metabolite Exchange with the CytosolIf chloroplasts are isolated in a way that leaves their inner membrane intact, this membrane can be shown to have a selective permeability, reflecting the presence of specific carrier proteins. Most notably, much of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced by CO2 fixation in the chloroplast stroma is transported out of the chloroplast by an efficient antiport system that exchanges three-carbon sugar phosphates for an inward flux of inorganic phosphate.Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate normally provides the cytosol with an abundant source of carbohydrate, which is used by the cell as the starting point for many other biosyntheses—including the production of sucrose for export. But this is not all that this molecule provides. Once the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate reaches the cytosol, it is readily converted (by part of the glycolytic pathway) to 1,3-phosphoglycerate and then 3-phosphoglycerate (see p. 97), generating one molecule of ATP and one of NADH. (A similar two-step reaction, but working in reverse, forms glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the carbon-fixation cycle; see Figure 14-39.) As a result, the export of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate from the chloroplast provides not only the main source of fixed carbon to the rest of the cell, but also the reducing power and ATP needed for metabolism outside the chloroplast.Chloroplasts Also Perform Other Crucial BiosynthesesThe chloroplast performs many biosyntheses in addition to photosynthesis. All of the cell's fatty acids and a number of amino acids, for example, are made by enzymes in the chloroplast stroma. Similarly, the reducing power of light-activated electrons drives the reduction of nitrite (NO2-) to ammonia (NH3) in the chloroplast; this ammonia provides the plant with nitrogen for the synthesis of amino acids and nucleotides. The metabolic importance of the chloroplast for plants and algae therefore extends far beyond its role in photosynthesis.SummaryChloroplasts and photosynthetic bacteria obtain high-energy electrons by means of photosystems that capture the electrons that are excited when sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules. Photosystems are composed of an antenna complex that funnels energy to a photochemical reaction center, where a precisely ordered complex of proteins and pigments allows the energy of an excited electron in chlorophyll to be captured by electron carriers. The best-understood photochemical reaction center is that of purple photosynthetic bacteria, which contain only a single photosystem. In contrast, there are two distinct photosystems in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. The two photosystems are normally linked in series, and they transfer electrons from water to NADP+ to form NADPH, with the concomitant production of a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient. In these linked photosystems, molecular oxygen (O2) is generated as a by-product of removing four low-energy electrons from two specifically positioned water molecules.Compared with mitochondria, chloroplasts have an additional internal membrane (the thylakoid membrane) and a third internal space (the thylakoid space). All electron-transport processes occur in the thylakoid membrane: to make ATP, H+ is pumped into the thylakoid space, and a backflow of H+ through an ATP synthase then produces the ATP in the chloroplast stroma. This ATP is used in conjunction with the NADPH made by photosynthesis to drive a large number of biosynthetic reactions in the chloroplast stroma, including the all-important carbon-fixation cycle, which creates carbohydrate from CO2. Along with some other important chloroplast products, this carbohydrate is exported to the cell cytosol, where—as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate—it provides organic carbon, ATP, and reducing power to the rest of the cell.

  "Chloroplasts and PhotosynthesisAll animals and most microorganisms rely on the continual uptake of large amounts of organic compounds from their environment. These compounds are used to provide both the carbon skeletons for biosynthesis and the metabolic energy that drives cellular processes. It is believed that the first organisms on the primitive Earth had access to an abundance of the organic compounds produced by geochemical processes, but that most of these original compounds were used up billions of years ago. Since that time, the vast majority of the organic materials required by living cells have been produced by photosynthetic organisms, including many types of photosynthetic bacteria.The most advanced photosynthetic bacteria are the cyanobacteria, which have minimal nutrient requirements. They use electrons from water and the energy of sunlight when they convert atmospheric CO2 into organic compounds—a process called carbon fixation. In the course of splitting water [in the overall reaction nH2O + nCO2 (CH2O)n + nO2], they also liberate into the atmosphere the oxygen required for oxidative phosphorylation. As we see in this section, it is thought that the evolution of cyanobacteria from more primitive photosynthetic bacteria eventually made possible the development of abundant aerobic life forms.In plants and algae, which developed much later, photosynthesis occurs in a specialized intracellular organelle—the chloroplast. Chloroplasts perform photosynthesis during the daylight hours. The immediate products of photosynthesis, NADPH and ATP, are used by the photosynthetic cells to produce many organic molecules. In plants, the products include a low-molecular-weight sugar (usually sucrose) that is exported to meet the metabolic needs of the many nonphotosynthetic cells of the organism.Biochemical and genetic evidence strongly suggest that chloroplasts are descendants of oxygen-producing photosynthetic bacteria that were endocytosed and lived in symbiosis with primitive eucaryotic cells. Mitochondria are also generally believed to be descended from an endocytosed bacterium. The many differences between chloroplasts and mitochondria are thought to reflect their different bacterial ancestors, as well as their subsequent evolutionary divergence. Nevertheless, the fundamental mechanisms involved in light-driven ATP synthesis in chloroplasts are very similar to those that we have already discussed for respiration-driven ATP synthesis in mitochondria.The Chloroplast Is One Member of the Plastid Family of OrganellesChloroplasts are the most prominent members of the plastid family of organelles. Plastids are present in all living plant cells, each cell type having its own characteristic complement. All plastids share certain features. Most notably, all plastids in a particular plant species contain multiple copies of the same relatively small genome. In addition, each is enclosed by an envelope composed of two concentric membranes.As discussed in Chapter 12 (see Figure 12-3), all plastids develop from proplastids, small organelles in the immature cells of plant meristems (Figure 14-33A). Proplastids develop according to the requirements of each differentiated cell, and the type that is present is determined in large part by the nuclear genome. If a leaf is grown in darkness, its proplastids enlarge and develop into etioplasts, which have a semicrystalline array of internal membranes containing a yellow chlorophyll precursor instead of chlorophyll. When exposed to light, the etioplasts rapidly develop into chloroplasts by converting this precursor to chlorophyll and by synthesizing new membrane pigments, photosynthetic enzymes, and components of the electron-transport chain. Figure 14-33Plastid diversity. (A) A proplastid from a root tip cell of a bean plant. Note the double membrane; the inner membrane has also generated the relatively sparse internal membranes present. (B) Three amyloplasts (a form of leucoplast), or starch-storing (more...) Leucoplasts are plastids present in many epidermal and internal tissues that do not become green and photosynthetic. They are little more than enlarged proplastids. A common form of leucoplast is the amyloplast (Figure 14-33B), which accumulates the polysaccharide starch in storage tissues—a source of sugar for future use. In some plants, such as potatoes, the amyloplasts can grow to be as large as an average animal cell.It is important to realize that plastids are not just sites for photosynthesis and the deposition of storage materials. Plants have also used their plastids to compartmentalize their intermediary metabolism. Purine and pyrimidine synthesis, most amino acid synthesis, and all of the fatty acid synthesis of plants takes place in the plastids, whereas in animal cells these compounds are produced in the cytosol.Chloroplasts Resemble Mitochondria But Have an Extra CompartmentChloroplasts carry out their energy interconversions by chemiosmotic mechanisms in much the same way that mitochondria do. Although much larger (Figure 14-34A), they are organized on the same principles. They have a highly permeable outer membrane; a much less permeable inner membrane, in which membrane transport proteins are embedded; and a narrow intermembrane space in between. Together, these membranes form the chloroplast envelope (Figure 14-34B,C). The inner membrane surrounds a large space called the stroma, which is analogous to the mitochondrial matrix and contains many metabolic enzymes. Like the mitochondrion, the chloroplast has its own genome and genetic system. The stroma therefore also contains a special set of ribosomes, RNAs, and the chloroplast DNA. Figure 14-34Electron micrographs of chloroplasts. (A) In a wheat leaf cell, a thin rim of cytoplasm—containing chloroplasts, the nucleus, and mitochondria—surrounds a large vacuole. (B) A thin section of a single chloroplast, showing the chloroplast (more...)There is, however, an important difference between the organization of mitochondria and that of chloroplasts. The inner membrane of the chloroplast is not folded into cristae and does not contain electron-transport chains. Instead, the electron-transport chains, photosynthetic light-capturing systems, and ATP synthase are all contained in the thylakoid membrane, a third distinct membrane that forms a set of flattened disclike sacs, the thylakoids (Figure 14-35). The lumen of each thylakoid is thought to be connected with the lumen of other thylakoids, thereby defining a third internal compartment called the thylakoid space, which is separated by the thylakoid membrane from the stroma that surrounds it. Figure 14-35The chloroplast. This photosynthetic organelle contains three distinct membranes (the outer membrane, the inner membrane, and the thylakoid membrane) that define three separate internal compartments (the intermembrane space, the stroma, and the thylakoid (more...)The structural similarities and differences between mitochondria and chloroplasts are illustrated in Figure 14-36. The head of the chloroplast ATP synthase, where ATP is made, protrudes from the thylakoid membrane into the stroma, whereas it protrudes into the matrix from the inner mitochondrial membrane. Figure 14-36A mitochondrion and chloroplast compared. A chloroplast is generally much larger than a mitochondrion and contains, in addition to an outer and inner membrane, a thylakoid membrane enclosing a thylakoid space. Unlike the chloroplast inner membrane, the (more...)Chloroplasts Capture Energy from Sunlight and Use It to Fix CarbonThe many reactions that occur during photosynthesis in plants can be grouped into two broad categories: 1.In the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions (also called the “light reactions”), energy derived from sunlight energizes an electron in the green organic pigment chlorophyll, enabling the electron to move along an electron-transport chain in the thylakoid membrane in much the same way that an electron moves along the respiratory chain in mitochondria. The chlorophyll obtains its electrons from water (H2O), producing O2 as a by-product. During the electron-transport process, H+ is pumped across the thylakoid membrane, and the resulting electrochemical proton gradient drives the synthesis of ATP in the stroma. As the final step in this series of reactions, high-energy electrons are loaded (together with H+) onto NADP+, converting it to NADPH. All of these reactions are confined to the chloroplast.2.In the carbon-fixation reactions (also called the “dark reactions”), the ATP and the NADPH produced by the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions serve as the source of energy and reducing power, respectively, to drive the conversion of CO2 to carbohydrate. The carbon-fixation reactions, which begin in the chloroplast stroma and continue in the cytosol, produce sucrose and many other organic molecules in the leaves of the plant. The sucrose is exported to other tissues as a source of both organic molecules and energy for growth. Thus, the formation of ATP, NADPH, and O2 (which requires light energy directly) and the conversion of CO2 to carbohydrate (which requires light energy only indirectly) are separate processes (Figure 14-37), although elaborate feedback mechanisms interconnect the two. Several of the chloroplast enzymes required for carbon fixation, for example, are inactivated in the dark and reactivated by light-stimulated electron-transport processes. Figure 14-37The reactions of photosynthesis in a chloroplast. Water is oxidized and oxygen is released in the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions, while carbon dioxide is assimilated (fixed) to produce sugars and a variety of other organic molecules in the (more...)Carbon Fixation Is Catalyzed by Ribulose Bisphosphate CarboxylaseWe have seen earlier in this chapter how cells produce ATP by using the large amount of free energy released when carbohydrates are oxidized to CO2 and H2O. Clearly, therefore, the reverse reaction, in which CO2 and H2O combine to make carbohydrate, must be a very unfavorable one that can only occur if it is coupled to other, very favorable reactions that drive it.The central reaction of carbon fixation, in which an atom of inorganic carbon is converted to organic carbon, is illustrated in Figure 14-38: CO2 from the atmosphere combines with the five-carbon compound ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate plus water to yield two molecules of the three-carbon compound 3-phosphoglycerate. This “carbon-fixing” reaction, which was discovered in 1948, is catalyzed in the chloroplast stroma by a large enzyme called ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. Since each molecule of the complex works sluggishly (processing only about 3 molecules of substrate per second compared to 1000 molecules per second for a typical enzyme), many enzyme molecules are needed. Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase often constitutes more than 50% of the total chloroplast protein, and it is thought to be the most abundant protein on Earth. Figure 14-38The initial reaction in carbon fixation. This reaction, in which carbon dioxide is converted into organic carbon, is catalyzed in the chloroplast stroma by the abundant enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. The product is 3-phosphoglycerate, which (more...)Three Molecules of ATP and Two Molecules of NADPH Are Consumed for Each CO2 Molecule That Is FixedThe actual reaction in which CO2 is fixed is energetically favorable because of the reactivity of the energy-rich compound ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, to which each molecule of CO2 is added (see Figure 14-38). The elaborate metabolic pathway that produces ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate requires both NADPH and ATP; it was worked out in one of the first successful applications of radioisotopes as tracers in biochemistry. This carbon-fixation cycle (also called the Calvin cycle) is outlined in Figure 14-39. It starts when 3 molecules of CO2 are fixed by ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase to produce 6 molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (containing 6 × 3 = 18 carbon atoms in all: 3 from the CO2 and 15 from ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate). The 18 carbon atoms then undergo a cycle of reactions that regenerates the 3 molecules of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate used in the initial carbon-fixation step (containing 3 × 5 = 15 carbon atoms). This leaves 1 molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (3 carbon atoms) as the net gain. Figure 14-39The carbon-fixation cycle, which forms organic molecules from CO2 and H2O. The number of carbon atoms in each type of molecule is indicated in the white box. There are many intermediates between glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and ribulose 5-phosphate, but (more...)A total of 3 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of NADPH are consumed for each CO2 molecule converted into carbohydrate. The net equation is: Thus, both phosphate-bond energy (as ATP) and reducing power (as NADPH) are required for the formation of organic molecules from CO2 and H2O. We return to this important point later.The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced in chloroplasts by the carbon-fixation cycle is a three-carbon sugar that also serves as a central intermediate in glycolysis. Much of it is exported to the cytosol, where it can be converted into fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate by the reversal of several reactions in glycolysis (see Panel 2-8, pp. 124–125). The glucose 1-phosphate is then converted to the sugar nucleotide UDP-glucose, and this combines with the fructose 6-phosphate to form sucrose phosphate, the immediate precursor of the disaccharide sucrose. Sucrose is the major form in which sugar is transported between plant cells: just as glucose is transported in the blood of animals, sucrose is exported from the leaves via vascular bundles, providing the carbohydrate required by the rest of the plant.Most of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate that remains in the chloroplast is converted to starch in the stroma. Like glycogen in animal cells, starch is a large polymer of glucose that serves as a carbohydrate reserve (see Figure 14-33B). The production of starch is regulated so that it is produced and stored as large grains in the chloroplast stroma during periods of excess photosynthetic capacity. This occurs through reactions in the stroma that are the reverse of those in glycolysis: they convert glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to glucose 1-phosphate, which is then used to produce the sugar nucleotide ADP-glucose, the immediate precursor of starch. At night the starch is broken down to help support the metabolic needs of the plant. Starch provides an important part of the diet of all animals that eat plants.Carbon Fixation in Some Plants Is Compartmentalized to Facilitate Growth at Low CO2 ConcentrationsAlthough ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase preferentially adds CO2 to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, it can use O2 as a substrate in place of CO2, and if the concentration of CO2 is low, it will add O2 to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate instead (see Figure 14-38). This is the first step in a pathway called photorespiration, whose ultimate effect is to use up O2 and liberate CO2 without the production of useful energy stores. In many plants, about one-third of the CO2 fixed is lost again as CO2 because of photorespiration.Photorespiration can be a serious liability for plants in hot, dry conditions, which cause them to close their stomata (the gas exchange pores in their leaves) to avoid excessive water loss. This in turn causes the CO2 levels in the leaf to fall precipitously, thereby favoring photorespiration. A special adaptation, however, occurs in the leaves of many plants, such as corn and sugar cane that live in hot, dry environments. In these plants, the carbon-fixation cycle occurs only in the chloroplasts of specialized bundle-sheath cells, which contain all of the plant's ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. These cells are protected from the air and are surrounded by a specialized layer of mesophyll cells that use the energy harvested by their chloroplasts to “pump” CO2 into the bundle-sheath cells. This supplies the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase with a high concentration of CO2, thereby greatly reducing photorespiration.The CO2 pump is produced by a reaction cycle that begins in the cytosol of the mesophyll cells. A CO2-fixation step is catalyzed by an enzyme that binds carbon dioxide (as bicarbonate) and combines it with an activated three-carbon molecule to produce a four-carbon molecule. The four-carbon molecule diffuses into the bundle-sheath cells, where it is broken down to release the CO2 and generate a molecule with three carbons. The pumping cycle is completed when this three-carbon molecule is returned to the mesophyll cells and converted back to its original activated form. Because the CO2 is initially captured by converting it into a compound containing four carbons, the CO2-pumping plants are called C4 plants. All other plants are called C3 plants because they capture CO2 into the three-carbon compound 3-phosphoglycerate (Figure 14-40). Figure 14-40Comparative leaf anatomy in a C3 plant and a C4 plant. The cells with green cytosol in the leaf interior contain chloroplasts that perform the normal carbon-fixation cycle. In C4 plants, the mesophyll cells are specialized for CO2 pumping rather than (more...)As for any vectorial transport process, pumping CO2 into the bundle-sheath cells in C4 plants costs energy. In hot, dry environments, however, this cost can be much less than the energy lost by photorespiration in C3 plants, so C4 plants have a potential advantage. Moreover, because C4 plants can perform photosynthesis at a lower concentration of CO2 inside the leaf, they need to open their stomata less often and therefore can fix about twice as much net carbon as C3 plants per unit of water lost. Although the vast majority of plant species are C3 plants, C4 plants such as corn and sugar cane are much more effective at converting sunlight energy into biomass than C3 plants such as cereal grains. They are therefore of special importance in world agriculture.Photosynthesis Depends on the Photochemistry of Chlorophyll MoleculesHaving discussed the carbon-fixation reactions, we now return to the question of how the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions in the chloroplast generate the ATP and the NADPH needed to drive the production of carbohydrates from CO2 and H2O. The required energy is derived from sunlight absorbed by chlorophyll molecules (Figure 14-41). The process of energy conversion begins when a chlorophyll molecule is excited by a quantum of light (a photon) and an electron is moved from one molecular orbital to another of higher energy. As illustrated in Figure 14-42, such an excited molecule is unstable and tends to return to its original, unexcited state in one of three ways: Figure 14-41The structure of chlorophyll. A magnesium atom is held in a porphyrin ring, which is related to the porphyrin ring that binds iron in heme (see Figure 14-22). Electrons are delocalized over the bonds shown in blue. Figure 14-42Three ways for an excited chlorophyll molecule to return to its original, unexcited state. The light energy absorbed by an isolated chlorophyll molecule is completely released as light and heat by process 1. In photosynthesis, by contrast, chlorophylls (more...) 1.By converting the extra energy into heat (molecular motions) or to some combination of heat and light of a longer wavelength (fluorescence), which is what happens when light energy is absorbed by an isolated chlorophyll molecule in solution.2.By transferring the energy—but not the electron—directly to a neighboring chlorophyll molecule by a process called resonance energy transfer.3.By transferring the high-energy electron to another nearby molecule, an electron acceptor, and then returning to its original state by taking up a low-energy electron from some other molecule, an electron donor. The last two mechanisms are exploited in the process of photosynthesis.A Photosystem Consists of a Reaction Center Plus an Antenna ComplexMultiprotein complexes called photosystems catalyze the conversion of the light energy captured in excited chlorophyll molecules to useful forms. A photosystem consists of two closely linked components: an antenna complex, consisting of a large set of pigment molecules that capture light energy and feed it to the reaction center; and a photochemical reaction center, consisting of a complex of proteins and chlorophyll molecules that enable light energy to be converted into chemical energy (Figure 14-43). Figure 14-43The antenna complex and photochemical reaction center in a photosystem. The antenna complex is a collector of light energy in the form of excited electrons. The energy of the excited electrons is funneled, through a series of resonance energy transfers, (more...)The antenna complex is important for capturing light. In chloroplasts it consists of a number of distinct membrane protein complexes (known as light-harvesting complexes); together, these proteins bind several hundred chlorophyll molecules per reaction center, orienting them precisely in the thylakoid membrane. Depending on the plant, different amounts of accessory pigments called carotenoids, which protect the chlorophylls from oxidation and can help collect light of other wavelengths, are also located in each complex. When a chlorophyll molecule in the antenna complex is excited, the energy is rapidly transferred from one molecule to another by resonance energy transfer until it reaches a special pair of chlorophyll molecules in the photochemical reaction center. Each antenna complex thereby acts as a funnel, collecting light energy and directing it to a specific site where it can be used effectively (see Figure 14-43).The photochemical reaction center is a transmembrane protein-pigment complex that lies at the heart of photosynthesis. It is thought to have evolved more than 3 billion years ago in primitive photosynthetic bacteria. The special pair of chlorophyll molecules in the reaction center acts as an irreversible trap for excitation quanta because its excited electron is immediately passed to a chain of electron acceptors that are precisely positioned as neighbors in the same protein complex (Figure 14-44). By moving the high-energy electron rapidly away from the chlorophylls, the photochemical reaction center transfers it to an environment where it is much more stable. The electron is thereby suitably positioned for subsequent reactions, which require more time to complete. Figure 14-44The arrangement of the electron carriers in a bacterial photochemical reaction center, as determined by x-ray crystallography. The pigment molecules shown are held in the interior of a transmembrane protein and are surrounded by the lipid bilayer of the (more...)In a Reaction Center, Light Energy Captured by Chlorophyll Creates a Strong Electron Donor from a Weak OneThe electron transfers involved in the photochemical reactions just outlined have been analyzed extensively by rapid spectroscopic methods. An enormous amount of detailed information is available for the photosystem of purple bacteria, which is somewhat simpler than the evolutionarily related photosystems in chloroplasts. The reaction center in this photosystem is a large protein-pigment complex that can be solubilized with detergent and purified in active form. In 1985, its complete three-dimensional structure was determined by x-ray crystallography (see Figure 10-38). This structure, combined with kinetic data, provides the best picture we have of the initial electron-transfer reactions that underlie photosynthesis.The sequence of electron transfers that take place in the reaction center of purple bacteria is shown in Figure 14-45. As outlined previously for the general case (see Figure 14-43), light causes a net electron transfer from a weak electron donor (a molecule with a strong affinity for electrons) to a molecule that is a strong electron donor in its reduced form. The excitation energy in chlorophyll that would normally be released as fluorescence or heat is thereby used instead to create a strong electron donor (a molecule carrying a high-energy electron) where none had been before. In the purple bacterium, the weak electron donor used to fill the electron-deficient hole created by a light-induced charge separation is a cytochrome (see orange box in Figure 14-45); the strong electron donor produced is a quinone. In the chloroplasts of higher plants, a quinone is similarly produced. However, as we discuss next, water serves as the initial weak electron donor, which is why oxygen gas is released by photosynthesis in plants. Figure 14-45The electron transfers that occur in the photochemical reaction center of a purple bacterium. A similar set of reactions occurs in the evolutionarily related photosystem II in plants. At the top left is an orientating diagram showing the molecules that (more...)Noncyclic Photophosphorylation Produces Both NADPH and ATPPhotosynthesis in plants and cyanobacteria produces both ATP and NADPH directly by a two-step process called noncyclic photophosphorylation. Because two photosystems—called photosystems I and II—are used in series to energize an electron, the electron can be transferred all the way from water to NADPH. As the high-energy electrons pass through the coupled photosystems to generate NADPH, some of their energy is siphoned off for ATP synthesis.The first of the two photosystems—paradoxically called photosystem II for historical reasons—has the unique ability to withdraw electrons from water. The oxygens of two water molecules bind to a cluster of manganese atoms in a poorly understood water-splitting enzyme. This enzyme enables electrons to be removed one at a time from the water, as required to fill the electron-deficient holes created by light in chlorophyll molecules in the reaction center. As soon as four electrons have been removed from the two water molecules (requiring four quanta of light), O2 is released. Photosystem II thus catalyzes the reaction 2H2O + 4 photons → 4H+ + 4e - + O2. As we discussed for the electron-transport chain in mitochondria, which uses O2 and produces water, the mechanism ensures that no partly oxidized water molecules are released as dangerous, highly reactive oxygen radicals. Essentially all the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere has been produced in this way.The core of the reaction center in photosystem II is homologous to the bacterial reaction center just described, and it likewise produces strong electron donors in the form of reduced quinone molecules dissolved in the lipid bilayer of the membrane. The quinones pass their electrons to a H+ pump called the cytochrome b6-f complex, which resembles the cytochrome b-c1 complex in the respiratory chain of mitochondria. The cytochrome b6-f complex pumps H+ into the thylakoid space across the thylakoid membrane (or out of the cytosol across the plasma membrane in cyanobacteria), and the resulting electrochemical gradient drives the synthesis of ATP by an ATP synthase (Figure 14-46). Figure 14-46Electron flow during photosynthesis in the thylakoid membrane. The mobile electron carriers in the chain are plastoquinone (which closely resembles the ubiquinone of mitochondria), plastocyanin (a small copper-containing protein), and ferredoxin (a small (more...)The final electron acceptor in this electron-transport chain is the second photosystem, photosystem I, which accepts an electron into the electron-deficient hole created by light in the chlorophyll molecule in its reaction center. Each electron that enters photosystem I is finally boosted to a very high-energy level that allows it to be passed to the iron-sulfur center in ferredoxin and then to NADP+ to generate NADPH (Figure 14-47). Figure 14-47Changes in redox potential during photosynthesis. The redox potential for each molecule is indicated by its position along the vertical axis. In photosystem II, the excited reaction center chlorophyll has a redox potential high enough to withdraw electrons (more...)The scheme for photosynthesis just discussed is known as the Z scheme. By means of its two electron-energizing steps, one catalyzed by each photosystem, an electron is passed from water, which normally holds on to its electrons very tightly (redox potential = +820 mV), to NADPH, which normally holds on to its electrons loosely (redox potential = -320 mV). There is not enough energy in a single quantum of visible light to energize an electron all the way from the bottom of photosystem II to the top of photosystem I, which is presumably the energy change required to pass an electron efficiently from water to NADP+. The use of two separate photosystems in series means that the energy from two quanta of light is available for this purpose. In addition, there is enough energy left over to enable the electron-transport chain that links the two photosystems to pump H+ across the thylakoid membrane (or the plasma membrane of cyanobacteria), so that the ATP synthase can harness some of the light-derived energy for ATP production.Chloroplasts Can Make ATP by Cyclic Photophosphorylation Without Making NADPHIn the noncyclic photophosphorylation scheme just discussed, high-energy electrons leaving photosystem II are harnessed to generate ATP and are passed on to photosystem I to drive the production of NADPH. This produces slightly more than 1 molecule of ATP for every pair of electrons that passes from H2O to NADP+ to generate a molecule of NADPH. But 1.5 molecules of ATP per NADPH are needed for carbon fixation (see Figure 14-39). To produce extra ATP, the chloroplasts in some species of plants can switch photosystem I into a cyclic mode so that it produces ATP instead of NADPH. In this process, called cyclic photophosphorylation, the high-energy electrons from photosystem I are transferred to the cytochrome b6-f complex rather than being passed on to NADP+. From the b6-f complex, the electrons are passed back to photosystem I at a low energy. The only net result, besides the conversion of some light energy to heat, is that H+ is pumped across the thylakoid membrane by the b6-f complex as electrons pass through it, thereby increasing the electrochemical proton gradient that drives the ATP synthase. (This is analogous to the right side of the diagram for purple nonsulfur bacteria in Figure 14-71, below.) To summarize, cyclic photophosphorylation involves only photosystem I, and it produces ATP without the formation of either NADPH or O2. The relative activities of cyclic and noncyclic electron flows can be regulated by the cell to determine how much light energy is converted into reducing power (NADPH) and how much into high-energy phosphate bonds (ATP).Photosystems I and II Have Related Structures, and Also Resemble Bacterial PhotosystemsThe mechanisms of fundamental cell processes such as DNA replication or respiration generally turn out to be the same in eucaryotic cells and in bacteria, even though the number of protein components involved is considerably greater in eucaryotes. Eucaryotes evolved from procaryotes, and the additional proteins presumably were selected for during evolution because they provided an extra degree of efficiency and/or regulation that was useful to the cell.Photosystems provide a clear example of this type of evolution. Photosystem II, for example, is formed from more than 25 different protein subunits, creating a large assembly in the thylakoid membrane with a mass of about 1 million daltons. The atomic structures of the eucaryotic photosystems are being revealed by a combination of electron and x-ray crystallography. The task is difficult because the complexes are large and embedded in the lipid bilayer. Nevertheless, as illustrated in Figure 14-48, the close relationship of photosystem I, photosystem II, and the photochemical reaction center of purple bacteria has been clearly demonstrated from these atomic-level analyses. Figure 14-48Three types of photosynthetic reaction centers compared. Pigments involved in light harvesting are colored green; those involved in the central photochemical events are colored red. (A) The photochemical reaction center of purple bacteria, whose detailed (more...)The Proton-Motive Force Is the Same in Mitochondria and ChloroplastsThe presence of the thylakoid space separates a chloroplast into three rather than the two internal compartments of a mitochondrion. The net effect of H+ translocation in the two organelles is, however, similar. As illustrated in Figure 14-49, in chloroplasts, H+ is pumped out of the stroma (pH 8) into the thylakoid space (pH ~5), creating a gradient of 3–3.5 pH units. This represents a proton-motive force of about 200 mV across the thylakoid membrane, and it drives ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase embedded in this membrane. The force is the same as that across the inner mitochondrial membrane, but nearly all of it is contributed by the pH gradient rather than by a membrane potential, unlike the case in mitochondria. Figure 14-49A comparison of the flow of H+ and the orientation of the ATP synthase in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Those compartments with similar pH values have been colored the same. The proton-motive force across the thylakoid membrane consists almost entirely (more...)Like the stroma, the mitochondrial matrix has a pH of about 8. This is created by pumping H+ out of the mitochondrion into the cytosol (pH ~7) rather than into an interior space in the organelle. Thus, the pH gradient is relatively small, and most of the proton-motive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane is instead caused by the resulting membrane potential (see Figure 14-13).For both mitochondria and chloroplasts, the catalytic site of the ATP synthase is at a pH of about 8 and is located in a large organelle compartment (matrix or stroma) that is packed full of soluble enzymes. Consequently, it is here that all of the organelle's ATP is made (see Figure 14-49).Carrier Proteins in the Chloroplast Inner Membrane Control Metabolite Exchange with the CytosolIf chloroplasts are isolated in a way that leaves their inner membrane intact, this membrane can be shown to have a selective permeability, reflecting the presence of specific carrier proteins. Most notably, much of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced by CO2 fixation in the chloroplast stroma is transported out of the chloroplast by an efficient antiport system that exchanges three-carbon sugar phosphates for an inward flux of inorganic phosphate.Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate normally provides the cytosol with an abundant source of carbohydrate, which is used by the cell as the starting point for many other biosyntheses—including the production of sucrose for export. But this is not all that this molecule provides. Once the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate reaches the cytosol, it is readily converted (by part of the glycolytic pathway) to 1,3-phosphoglycerate and then 3-phosphoglycerate (see p. 97), generating one molecule of ATP and one of NADH. (A similar two-step reaction, but working in reverse, forms glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the carbon-fixation cycle; see Figure 14-39.) As a result, the export of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate from the chloroplast provides not only the main source of fixed carbon to the rest of the cell, but also the reducing power and ATP needed for metabolism outside the chloroplast.Chloroplasts Also Perform Other Crucial BiosynthesesThe chloroplast performs many biosyntheses in addition to photosynthesis. All of the cell's fatty acids and a number of amino acids, for example, are made by enzymes in the chloroplast stroma. Similarly, the reducing power of light-activated electrons drives the reduction of nitrite (NO2-) to ammonia (NH3) in the chloroplast; this ammonia provides the plant with nitrogen for the synthesis of amino acids and nucleotides. The metabolic importance of the chloroplast for plants and algae therefore extends far beyond its role in photosynthesis.SummaryChloroplasts and photosynthetic bacteria obtain high-energy electrons by means of photosystems that capture the electrons that are excited when sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules. Photosystems are composed of an antenna complex that funnels energy to a photochemical reaction center, where a precisely ordered complex of proteins and pigments allows the energy of an excited electron in chlorophyll to be captured by electron carriers. The best-understood photochemical reaction center is that of purple photosynthetic bacteria, which contain only a single photosystem. In contrast, there are two distinct photosystems in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. The two photosystems are normally linked in series, and they transfer electrons from water to NADP+ to form NADPH, with the concomitant production of a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient. In these linked photosystems, molecular oxygen (O2) is generated as a by-product of removing four low-energy electrons from two specifically positioned water molecules.Compared with mitochondria, chloroplasts have an additional internal membrane (the thylakoid membrane) and a third internal space (the thylakoid space). All electron-transport processes occur in the thylakoid membrane: to make ATP, H+ is pumped into the thylakoid space, and a backflow of H+ through an ATP synthase then produces the ATP in the chloroplast stroma. This ATP is used in conjunction with the NADPH made by photosynthesis to drive a large number of biosynthetic reactions in the chloroplast stroma, including the all-important carbon-fixation cycle, which creates carbohydrate from CO2. Along with some other important chloroplast products, this carbohydrate is exported to the cell cytosol, where—as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate—it provides organic carbon, ATP, and reducing power to the rest of the cell.",
  "All animals and most microorganisms rely on the continual uptake of large amounts of organic compounds from their environment. These compounds are used to provide both the carbon skeletons for biosynthesis and the metabolic energy that drives cellular processes. It is believed that the first organisms on the primitive Earth had access to an abundance of the organic compounds produced by geochemical processes, but that most of these original compounds were used up billions of years ago. Since that time, the vast majority of the organic materials required by living cells have been produced by photosynthetic organisms, including many types of photosynthetic bacteria.The most advanced photosynthetic bacteria are the cyanobacteria, which have minimal nutrient requirements. They use electrons from water and the energy of sunlight when they convert atmospheric CO2 into organic compounds—a process called carbon fixation. In the course of splitting water [in the overall reaction nH2O + nCO2 (CH2O)n + nO2], they also liberate into the atmosphere the oxygen required for oxidative phosphorylation. As we see in this section, it is thought that the evolution of cyanobacteria from more primitive photosynthetic bacteria eventually made possible the development of abundant aerobic life forms.In plants and algae, which developed much later, photosynthesis occurs in a specialized intracellular organelle—the chloroplast. Chloroplasts perform photosynthesis during the daylight hours. The immediate products of photosynthesis, NADPH and ATP, are used by the photosynthetic cells to produce many organic molecules. In plants, the products include a low-molecular-weight sugar (usually sucrose) that is exported to meet the metabolic needs of the many nonphotosynthetic cells of the organism.Biochemical and genetic evidence strongly suggest that chloroplasts are descendants of oxygen-producing photosynthetic bacteria that were endocytosed and lived in symbiosis with primitive eucaryotic cells. Mitochondria are also generally believed to be descended from an endocytosed bacterium. The many differences between chloroplasts and mitochondria are thought to reflect their different bacterial ancestors, as well as their subsequent evolutionary divergence. Nevertheless, the fundamental mechanisms involved in light-driven ATP synthesis in chloroplasts are very similar to those that we have already discussed for respiration-driven ATP synthesis in mitochondria.The Chloroplast Is One Member of the Plastid Family of OrganellesChloroplasts are the most prominent members of the plastid family of organelles. Plastids are present in all living plant cells, each cell type having its own characteristic complement. All plastids share certain features. Most notably, all plastids in a particular plant species contain multiple copies of the same relatively small genome. In addition, each is enclosed by an envelope composed of two concentric membranes.As discussed in Chapter 12 (see Figure 12-3), all plastids develop from proplastids, small organelles in the immature cells of plant meristems (Figure 14-33A). Proplastids develop according to the requirements of each differentiated cell, and the type that is present is determined in large part by the nuclear genome. If a leaf is grown in darkness, its proplastids enlarge and develop into etioplasts, which have a semicrystalline array of internal membranes containing a yellow chlorophyll precursor instead of chlorophyll. When exposed to light, the etioplasts rapidly develop into chloroplasts by converting this precursor to chlorophyll and by synthesizing new membrane pigments, photosynthetic enzymes, and components of the electron-transport chain. Figure 14-33Plastid diversity. (A) A proplastid from a root tip cell of a bean plant. Note the double membrane; the inner membrane has also generated the relatively sparse internal membranes present. (B) Three amyloplasts (a form of leucoplast), or starch-storing (more...) Leucoplasts are plastids present in many epidermal and internal tissues that do not become green and photosynthetic. They are little more than enlarged proplastids. A common form of leucoplast is the amyloplast (Figure 14-33B), which accumulates the polysaccharide starch in storage tissues—a source of sugar for future use. In some plants, such as potatoes, the amyloplasts can grow to be as large as an average animal cell.It is important to realize that plastids are not just sites for photosynthesis and the deposition of storage materials. Plants have also used their plastids to compartmentalize their intermediary metabolism. Purine and pyrimidine synthesis, most amino acid synthesis, and all of the fatty acid synthesis of plants takes place in the plastids, whereas in animal cells these compounds are produced in the cytosol.Chloroplasts Resemble Mitochondria But Have an Extra CompartmentChloroplasts carry out their energy interconversions by chemiosmotic mechanisms in much the same way that mitochondria do. Although much larger (Figure 14-34A), they are organized on the same principles. They have a highly permeable outer membrane; a much less permeable inner membrane, in which membrane transport proteins are embedded; and a narrow intermembrane space in between. Together, these membranes form the chloroplast envelope (Figure 14-34B,C). The inner membrane surrounds a large space called the stroma, which is analogous to the mitochondrial matrix and contains many metabolic enzymes. Like the mitochondrion, the chloroplast has its own genome and genetic system. The stroma therefore also contains a special set of ribosomes, RNAs, and the chloroplast DNA. Figure 14-34Electron micrographs of chloroplasts. (A) In a wheat leaf cell, a thin rim of cytoplasm—containing chloroplasts, the nucleus, and mitochondria—surrounds a large vacuole. (B) A thin section of a single chloroplast, showing the chloroplast (more...)There is, however, an important difference between the organization of mitochondria and that of chloroplasts. The inner membrane of the chloroplast is not folded into cristae and does not contain electron-transport chains. Instead, the electron-transport chains, photosynthetic light-capturing systems, and ATP synthase are all contained in the thylakoid membrane, a third distinct membrane that forms a set of flattened disclike sacs, the thylakoids (Figure 14-35). The lumen of each thylakoid is thought to be connected with the lumen of other thylakoids, thereby defining a third internal compartment called the thylakoid space, which is separated by the thylakoid membrane from the stroma that surrounds it. Figure 14-35The chloroplast. This photosynthetic organelle contains three distinct membranes (the outer membrane, the inner membrane, and the thylakoid membrane) that define three separate internal compartments (the intermembrane space, the stroma, and the thylakoid (more...)The structural similarities and differences between mitochondria and chloroplasts are illustrated in Figure 14-36. The head of the chloroplast ATP synthase, where ATP is made, protrudes from the thylakoid membrane into the stroma, whereas it protrudes into the matrix from the inner mitochondrial membrane. Figure 14-36A mitochondrion and chloroplast compared. A chloroplast is generally much larger than a mitochondrion and contains, in addition to an outer and inner membrane, a thylakoid membrane enclosing a thylakoid space. Unlike the chloroplast inner membrane, the (more...)Chloroplasts Capture Energy from Sunlight and Use It to Fix CarbonThe many reactions that occur during photosynthesis in plants can be grouped into two broad categories: 1.In the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions (also called the “light reactions”), energy derived from sunlight energizes an electron in the green organic pigment chlorophyll, enabling the electron to move along an electron-transport chain in the thylakoid membrane in much the same way that an electron moves along the respiratory chain in mitochondria. The chlorophyll obtains its electrons from water (H2O), producing O2 as a by-product. During the electron-transport process, H+ is pumped across the thylakoid membrane, and the resulting electrochemical proton gradient drives the synthesis of ATP in the stroma. As the final step in this series of reactions, high-energy electrons are loaded (together with H+) onto NADP+, converting it to NADPH. All of these reactions are confined to the chloroplast.2.In the carbon-fixation reactions (also called the “dark reactions”), the ATP and the NADPH produced by the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions serve as the source of energy and reducing power, respectively, to drive the conversion of CO2 to carbohydrate. The carbon-fixation reactions, which begin in the chloroplast stroma and continue in the cytosol, produce sucrose and many other organic molecules in the leaves of the plant. The sucrose is exported to other tissues as a source of both organic molecules and energy for growth. Thus, the formation of ATP, NADPH, and O2 (which requires light energy directly) and the conversion of CO2 to carbohydrate (which requires light energy only indirectly) are separate processes (Figure 14-37), although elaborate feedback mechanisms interconnect the two. Several of the chloroplast enzymes required for carbon fixation, for example, are inactivated in the dark and reactivated by light-stimulated electron-transport processes. Figure 14-37The reactions of photosynthesis in a chloroplast. Water is oxidized and oxygen is released in the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions, while carbon dioxide is assimilated (fixed) to produce sugars and a variety of other organic molecules in the (more...)Carbon Fixation Is Catalyzed by Ribulose Bisphosphate CarboxylaseWe have seen earlier in this chapter how cells produce ATP by using the large amount of free energy released when carbohydrates are oxidized to CO2 and H2O. Clearly, therefore, the reverse reaction, in which CO2 and H2O combine to make carbohydrate, must be a very unfavorable one that can only occur if it is coupled to other, very favorable reactions that drive it.The central reaction of carbon fixation, in which an atom of inorganic carbon is converted to organic carbon, is illustrated in Figure 14-38: CO2 from the atmosphere combines with the five-carbon compound ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate plus water to yield two molecules of the three-carbon compound 3-phosphoglycerate. This “carbon-fixing” reaction, which was discovered in 1948, is catalyzed in the chloroplast stroma by a large enzyme called ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. Since each molecule of the complex works sluggishly (processing only about 3 molecules of substrate per second compared to 1000 molecules per second for a typical enzyme), many enzyme molecules are needed. Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase often constitutes more than 50% of the total chloroplast protein, and it is thought to be the most abundant protein on Earth. Figure 14-38The initial reaction in carbon fixation. This reaction, in which carbon dioxide is converted into organic carbon, is catalyzed in the chloroplast stroma by the abundant enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. The product is 3-phosphoglycerate, which (more...)Three Molecules of ATP and Two Molecules of NADPH Are Consumed for Each CO2 Molecule That Is FixedThe actual reaction in which CO2 is fixed is energetically favorable because of the reactivity of the energy-rich compound ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, to which each molecule of CO2 is added (see Figure 14-38). The elaborate metabolic pathway that produces ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate requires both NADPH and ATP; it was worked out in one of the first successful applications of radioisotopes as tracers in biochemistry. This carbon-fixation cycle (also called the Calvin cycle) is outlined in Figure 14-39. It starts when 3 molecules of CO2 are fixed by ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase to produce 6 molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (containing 6 × 3 = 18 carbon atoms in all: 3 from the CO2 and 15 from ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate). The 18 carbon atoms then undergo a cycle of reactions that regenerates the 3 molecules of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate used in the initial carbon-fixation step (containing 3 × 5 = 15 carbon atoms). This leaves 1 molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (3 carbon atoms) as the net gain. Figure 14-39The carbon-fixation cycle, which forms organic molecules from CO2 and H2O. The number of carbon atoms in each type of molecule is indicated in the white box. There are many intermediates between glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and ribulose 5-phosphate, but (more...)A total of 3 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of NADPH are consumed for each CO2 molecule converted into carbohydrate. The net equation is: Thus, both phosphate-bond energy (as ATP) and reducing power (as NADPH) are required for the formation of organic molecules from CO2 and H2O. We return to this important point later.The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced in chloroplasts by the carbon-fixation cycle is a three-carbon sugar that also serves as a central intermediate in glycolysis. Much of it is exported to the cytosol, where it can be converted into fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate by the reversal of several reactions in glycolysis (see Panel 2-8, pp. 124–125). The glucose 1-phosphate is then converted to the sugar nucleotide UDP-glucose, and this combines with the fructose 6-phosphate to form sucrose phosphate, the immediate precursor of the disaccharide sucrose. Sucrose is the major form in which sugar is transported between plant cells: just as glucose is transported in the blood of animals, sucrose is exported from the leaves via vascular bundles, providing the carbohydrate required by the rest of the plant.Most of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate that remains in the chloroplast is converted to starch in the stroma. Like glycogen in animal cells, starch is a large polymer of glucose that serves as a carbohydrate reserve (see Figure 14-33B). The production of starch is regulated so that it is produced and stored as large grains in the chloroplast stroma during periods of excess photosynthetic capacity. This occurs through reactions in the stroma that are the reverse of those in glycolysis: they convert glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to glucose 1-phosphate, which is then used to produce the sugar nucleotide ADP-glucose, the immediate precursor of starch. At night the starch is broken down to help support the metabolic needs of the plant. Starch provides an important part of the diet of all animals that eat plants.Carbon Fixation in Some Plants Is Compartmentalized to Facilitate Growth at Low CO2 ConcentrationsAlthough ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase preferentially adds CO2 to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, it can use O2 as a substrate in place of CO2, and if the concentration of CO2 is low, it will add O2 to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate instead (see Figure 14-38). This is the first step in a pathway called photorespiration, whose ultimate effect is to use up O2 and liberate CO2 without the production of useful energy stores. In many plants, about one-third of the CO2 fixed is lost again as CO2 because of photorespiration.Photorespiration can be a serious liability for plants in hot, dry conditions, which cause them to close their stomata (the gas exchange pores in their leaves) to avoid excessive water loss. This in turn causes the CO2 levels in the leaf to fall precipitously, thereby favoring photorespiration. A special adaptation, however, occurs in the leaves of many plants, such as corn and sugar cane that live in hot, dry environments. In these plants, the carbon-fixation cycle occurs only in the chloroplasts of specialized bundle-sheath cells, which contain all of the plant's ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. These cells are protected from the air and are surrounded by a specialized layer of mesophyll cells that use the energy harvested by their chloroplasts to “pump” CO2 into the bundle-sheath cells. This supplies the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase with a high concentration of CO2, thereby greatly reducing photorespiration.The CO2 pump is produced by a reaction cycle that begins in the cytosol of the mesophyll cells. A CO2-fixation step is catalyzed by an enzyme that binds carbon dioxide (as bicarbonate) and combines it with an activated three-carbon molecule to produce a four-carbon molecule. The four-carbon molecule diffuses into the bundle-sheath cells, where it is broken down to release the CO2 and generate a molecule with three carbons. The pumping cycle is completed when this three-carbon molecule is returned to the mesophyll cells and converted back to its original activated form. Because the CO2 is initially captured by converting it into a compound containing four carbons, the CO2-pumping plants are called C4 plants. All other plants are called C3 plants because they capture CO2 into the three-carbon compound 3-phosphoglycerate (Figure 14-40). Figure 14-40Comparative leaf anatomy in a C3 plant and a C4 plant. The cells with green cytosol in the leaf interior contain chloroplasts that perform the normal carbon-fixation cycle. In C4 plants, the mesophyll cells are specialized for CO2 pumping rather than (more...)As for any vectorial transport process, pumping CO2 into the bundle-sheath cells in C4 plants costs energy. In hot, dry environments, however, this cost can be much less than the energy lost by photorespiration in C3 plants, so C4 plants have a potential advantage. Moreover, because C4 plants can perform photosynthesis at a lower concentration of CO2 inside the leaf, they need to open their stomata less often and therefore can fix about twice as much net carbon as C3 plants per unit of water lost. Although the vast majority of plant species are C3 plants, C4 plants such as corn and sugar cane are much more effective at converting sunlight energy into biomass than C3 plants such as cereal grains. They are therefore of special importance in world agriculture.Photosynthesis Depends on the Photochemistry of Chlorophyll MoleculesHaving discussed the carbon-fixation reactions, we now return to the question of how the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions in the chloroplast generate the ATP and the NADPH needed to drive the production of carbohydrates from CO2 and H2O. The required energy is derived from sunlight absorbed by chlorophyll molecules (Figure 14-41). The process of energy conversion begins when a chlorophyll molecule is excited by a quantum of light (a photon) and an electron is moved from one molecular orbital to another of higher energy. As illustrated in Figure 14-42, such an excited molecule is unstable and tends to return to its original, unexcited state in one of three ways: Figure 14-41The structure of chlorophyll. A magnesium atom is held in a porphyrin ring, which is related to the porphyrin ring that binds iron in heme (see Figure 14-22). Electrons are delocalized over the bonds shown in blue. Figure 14-42Three ways for an excited chlorophyll molecule to return to its original, unexcited state. The light energy absorbed by an isolated chlorophyll molecule is completely released as light and heat by process 1. In photosynthesis, by contrast, chlorophylls (more...) 1.By converting the extra energy into heat (molecular motions) or to some combination of heat and light of a longer wavelength (fluorescence), which is what happens when light energy is absorbed by an isolated chlorophyll molecule in solution.2.By transferring the energy—but not the electron—directly to a neighboring chlorophyll molecule by a process called resonance energy transfer.3.By transferring the high-energy electron to another nearby molecule, an electron acceptor, and then returning to its original state by taking up a low-energy electron from some other molecule, an electron donor. The last two mechanisms are exploited in the process of photosynthesis.A Photosystem Consists of a Reaction Center Plus an Antenna ComplexMultiprotein complexes called photosystems catalyze the conversion of the light energy captured in excited chlorophyll molecules to useful forms. A photosystem consists of two closely linked components: an antenna complex, consisting of a large set of pigment molecules that capture light energy and feed it to the reaction center; and a photochemical reaction center, consisting of a complex of proteins and chlorophyll molecules that enable light energy to be converted into chemical energy (Figure 14-43). Figure 14-43The antenna complex and photochemical reaction center in a photosystem. The antenna complex is a collector of light energy in the form of excited electrons. The energy of the excited electrons is funneled, through a series of resonance energy transfers, (more...)The antenna complex is important for capturing light. In chloroplasts it consists of a number of distinct membrane protein complexes (known as light-harvesting complexes); together, these proteins bind several hundred chlorophyll molecules per reaction center, orienting them precisely in the thylakoid membrane. Depending on the plant, different amounts of accessory pigments called carotenoids, which protect the chlorophylls from oxidation and can help collect light of other wavelengths, are also located in each complex. When a chlorophyll molecule in the antenna complex is excited, the energy is rapidly transferred from one molecule to another by resonance energy transfer until it reaches a special pair of chlorophyll molecules in the photochemical reaction center. Each antenna complex thereby acts as a funnel, collecting light energy and directing it to a specific site where it can be used effectively (see Figure 14-43).The photochemical reaction center is a transmembrane protein-pigment complex that lies at the heart of photosynthesis. It is thought to have evolved more than 3 billion years ago in primitive photosynthetic bacteria. The special pair of chlorophyll molecules in the reaction center acts as an irreversible trap for excitation quanta because its excited electron is immediately passed to a chain of electron acceptors that are precisely positioned as neighbors in the same protein complex (Figure 14-44). By moving the high-energy electron rapidly away from the chlorophylls, the photochemical reaction center transfers it to an environment where it is much more stable. The electron is thereby suitably positioned for subsequent reactions, which require more time to complete. Figure 14-44The arrangement of the electron carriers in a bacterial photochemical reaction center, as determined by x-ray crystallography. The pigment molecules shown are held in the interior of a transmembrane protein and are surrounded by the lipid bilayer of the (more...)In a Reaction Center, Light Energy Captured by Chlorophyll Creates a Strong Electron Donor from a Weak OneThe electron transfers involved in the photochemical reactions just outlined have been analyzed extensively by rapid spectroscopic methods. An enormous amount of detailed information is available for the photosystem of purple bacteria, which is somewhat simpler than the evolutionarily related photosystems in chloroplasts. The reaction center in this photosystem is a large protein-pigment complex that can be solubilized with detergent and purified in active form. In 1985, its complete three-dimensional structure was determined by x-ray crystallography (see Figure 10-38). This structure, combined with kinetic data, provides the best picture we have of the initial electron-transfer reactions that underlie photosynthesis.The sequence of electron transfers that take place in the reaction center of purple bacteria is shown in Figure 14-45. As outlined previously for the general case (see Figure 14-43), light causes a net electron transfer from a weak electron donor (a molecule with a strong affinity for electrons) to a molecule that is a strong electron donor in its reduced form. The excitation energy in chlorophyll that would normally be released as fluorescence or heat is thereby used instead to create a strong electron donor (a molecule carrying a high-energy electron) where none had been before. In the purple bacterium, the weak electron donor used to fill the electron-deficient hole created by a light-induced charge separation is a cytochrome (see orange box in Figure 14-45); the strong electron donor produced is a quinone. In the chloroplasts of higher plants, a quinone is similarly produced. However, as we discuss next, water serves as the initial weak electron donor, which is why oxygen gas is released by photosynthesis in plants. Figure 14-45The electron transfers that occur in the photochemical reaction center of a purple bacterium. A similar set of reactions occurs in the evolutionarily related photosystem II in plants. At the top left is an orientating diagram showing the molecules that (more...)Noncyclic Photophosphorylation Produces Both NADPH and ATPPhotosynthesis in plants and cyanobacteria produces both ATP and NADPH directly by a two-step process called noncyclic photophosphorylation. Because two photosystems—called photosystems I and II—are used in series to energize an electron, the electron can be transferred all the way from water to NADPH. As the high-energy electrons pass through the coupled photosystems to generate NADPH, some of their energy is siphoned off for ATP synthesis.The first of the two photosystems—paradoxically called photosystem II for historical reasons—has the unique ability to withdraw electrons from water. The oxygens of two water molecules bind to a cluster of manganese atoms in a poorly understood water-splitting enzyme. This enzyme enables electrons to be removed one at a time from the water, as required to fill the electron-deficient holes created by light in chlorophyll molecules in the reaction center. As soon as four electrons have been removed from the two water molecules (requiring four quanta of light), O2 is released. Photosystem II thus catalyzes the reaction 2H2O + 4 photons → 4H+ + 4e - + O2. As we discussed for the electron-transport chain in mitochondria, which uses O2 and produces water, the mechanism ensures that no partly oxidized water molecules are released as dangerous, highly reactive oxygen radicals. Essentially all the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere has been produced in this way.The core of the reaction center in photosystem II is homologous to the bacterial reaction center just described, and it likewise produces strong electron donors in the form of reduced quinone molecules dissolved in the lipid bilayer of the membrane. The quinones pass their electrons to a H+ pump called the cytochrome b6-f complex, which resembles the cytochrome b-c1 complex in the respiratory chain of mitochondria. The cytochrome b6-f complex pumps H+ into the thylakoid space across the thylakoid membrane (or out of the cytosol across the plasma membrane in cyanobacteria), and the resulting electrochemical gradient drives the synthesis of ATP by an ATP synthase (Figure 14-46). Figure 14-46Electron flow during photosynthesis in the thylakoid membrane. The mobile electron carriers in the chain are plastoquinone (which closely resembles the ubiquinone of mitochondria), plastocyanin (a small copper-containing protein), and ferredoxin (a small (more...)The final electron acceptor in this electron-transport chain is the second photosystem, photosystem I, which accepts an electron into the electron-deficient hole created by light in the chlorophyll molecule in its reaction center. Each electron that enters photosystem I is finally boosted to a very high-energy level that allows it to be passed to the iron-sulfur center in ferredoxin and then to NADP+ to generate NADPH (Figure 14-47). Figure 14-47Changes in redox potential during photosynthesis. The redox potential for each molecule is indicated by its position along the vertical axis. In photosystem II, the excited reaction center chlorophyll has a redox potential high enough to withdraw electrons (more...)The scheme for photosynthesis just discussed is known as the Z scheme. By means of its two electron-energizing steps, one catalyzed by each photosystem, an electron is passed from water, which normally holds on to its electrons very tightly (redox potential = +820 mV), to NADPH, which normally holds on to its electrons loosely (redox potential = -320 mV). There is not enough energy in a single quantum of visible light to energize an electron all the way from the bottom of photosystem II to the top of photosystem I, which is presumably the energy change required to pass an electron efficiently from water to NADP+. The use of two separate photosystems in series means that the energy from two quanta of light is available for this purpose. In addition, there is enough energy left over to enable the electron-transport chain that links the two photosystems to pump H+ across the thylakoid membrane (or the plasma membrane of cyanobacteria), so that the ATP synthase can harness some of the light-derived energy for ATP production.Chloroplasts Can Make ATP by Cyclic Photophosphorylation Without Making NADPHIn the noncyclic photophosphorylation scheme just discussed, high-energy electrons leaving photosystem II are harnessed to generate ATP and are passed on to photosystem I to drive the production of NADPH. This produces slightly more than 1 molecule of ATP for every pair of electrons that passes from H2O to NADP+ to generate a molecule of NADPH. But 1.5 molecules of ATP per NADPH are needed for carbon fixation (see Figure 14-39). To produce extra ATP, the chloroplasts in some species of plants can switch photosystem I into a cyclic mode so that it produces ATP instead of NADPH. In this process, called cyclic photophosphorylation, the high-energy electrons from photosystem I are transferred to the cytochrome b6-f complex rather than being passed on to NADP+. From the b6-f complex, the electrons are passed back to photosystem I at a low energy. The only net result, besides the conversion of some light energy to heat, is that H+ is pumped across the thylakoid membrane by the b6-f complex as electrons pass through it, thereby increasing the electrochemical proton gradient that drives the ATP synthase. (This is analogous to the right side of the diagram for purple nonsulfur bacteria in Figure 14-71, below.) To summarize, cyclic photophosphorylation involves only photosystem I, and it produces ATP without the formation of either NADPH or O2. The relative activities of cyclic and noncyclic electron flows can be regulated by the cell to determine how much light energy is converted into reducing power (NADPH) and how much into high-energy phosphate bonds (ATP).Photosystems I and II Have Related Structures, and Also Resemble Bacterial PhotosystemsThe mechanisms of fundamental cell processes such as DNA replication or respiration generally turn out to be the same in eucaryotic cells and in bacteria, even though the number of protein components involved is considerably greater in eucaryotes. Eucaryotes evolved from procaryotes, and the additional proteins presumably were selected for during evolution because they provided an extra degree of efficiency and/or regulation that was useful to the cell.Photosystems provide a clear example of this type of evolution. Photosystem II, for example, is formed from more than 25 different protein subunits, creating a large assembly in the thylakoid membrane with a mass of about 1 million daltons. The atomic structures of the eucaryotic photosystems are being revealed by a combination of electron and x-ray crystallography. The task is difficult because the complexes are large and embedded in the lipid bilayer. Nevertheless, as illustrated in Figure 14-48, the close relationship of photosystem I, photosystem II, and the photochemical reaction center of purple bacteria has been clearly demonstrated from these atomic-level analyses. Figure 14-48Three types of photosynthetic reaction centers compared. Pigments involved in light harvesting are colored green; those involved in the central photochemical events are colored red. (A) The photochemical reaction center of purple bacteria, whose detailed (more...)The Proton-Motive Force Is the Same in Mitochondria and ChloroplastsThe presence of the thylakoid space separates a chloroplast into three rather than the two internal compartments of a mitochondrion. The net effect of H+ translocation in the two organelles is, however, similar. As illustrated in Figure 14-49, in chloroplasts, H+ is pumped out of the stroma (pH 8) into the thylakoid space (pH ~5), creating a gradient of 3–3.5 pH units. This represents a proton-motive force of about 200 mV across the thylakoid membrane, and it drives ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase embedded in this membrane. The force is the same as that across the inner mitochondrial membrane, but nearly all of it is contributed by the pH gradient rather than by a membrane potential, unlike the case in mitochondria. Figure 14-49A comparison of the flow of H+ and the orientation of the ATP synthase in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Those compartments with similar pH values have been colored the same. The proton-motive force across the thylakoid membrane consists almost entirely (more...)Like the stroma, the mitochondrial matrix has a pH of about 8. This is created by pumping H+ out of the mitochondrion into the cytosol (pH ~7) rather than into an interior space in the organelle. Thus, the pH gradient is relatively small, and most of the proton-motive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane is instead caused by the resulting membrane potential (see Figure 14-13).For both mitochondria and chloroplasts, the catalytic site of the ATP synthase is at a pH of about 8 and is located in a large organelle compartment (matrix or stroma) that is packed full of soluble enzymes. Consequently, it is here that all of the organelle's ATP is made (see Figure 14-49).Carrier Proteins in the Chloroplast Inner Membrane Control Metabolite Exchange with the CytosolIf chloroplasts are isolated in a way that leaves their inner membrane intact, this membrane can be shown to have a selective permeability, reflecting the presence of specific carrier proteins. Most notably, much of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced by CO2 fixation in the chloroplast stroma is transported out of the chloroplast by an efficient antiport system that exchanges three-carbon sugar phosphates for an inward flux of inorganic phosphate.Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate normally provides the cytosol with an abundant source of carbohydrate, which is used by the cell as the starting point for many other biosyntheses—including the production of sucrose for export. But this is not all that this molecule provides. Once the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate reaches the cytosol, it is readily converted (by part of the glycolytic pathway) to 1,3-phosphoglycerate and then 3-phosphoglycerate (see p. 97), generating one molecule of ATP and one of NADH. (A similar two-step reaction, but working in reverse, forms glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the carbon-fixation cycle; see Figure 14-39.) As a result, the export of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate from the chloroplast provides not only the main source of fixed carbon to the rest of the cell, but also the reducing power and ATP needed for metabolism outside the chloroplast.Chloroplasts Also Perform Other Crucial BiosynthesesThe chloroplast performs many biosyntheses in addition to photosynthesis. All of the cell's fatty acids and a number of amino acids, for example, are made by enzymes in the chloroplast stroma. Similarly, the reducing power of light-activated electrons drives the reduction of nitrite (NO2-) to ammonia (NH3) in the chloroplast; this ammonia provides the plant with nitrogen for the synthesis of amino acids and nucleotides. The metabolic importance of the chloroplast for plants and algae therefore extends far beyond its role in photosynthesis.SummaryChloroplasts and photosynthetic bacteria obtain high-energy electrons by means of photosystems that capture the electrons that are excited when sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules. Photosystems are composed of an antenna complex that funnels energy to a photochemical reaction center, where a precisely ordered complex of proteins and pigments allows the energy of an excited electron in chlorophyll to be captured by electron carriers. The best-understood photochemical reaction center is that of purple photosynthetic bacteria, which contain only a single photosystem. In contrast, there are two distinct photosystems in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. The two photosystems are normally linked in series, and they transfer electrons from water to NADP+ to form NADPH, with the concomitant production of a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient. In these linked photosystems, molecular oxygen (O2) is generated as a by-product of removing four low-energy electrons from two specifically positioned water molecules.Compared with mitochondria, chloroplasts have an additional internal membrane (the thylakoid membrane) and a third internal space (the thylakoid space). All electron-transport processes occur in the thylakoid membrane: to make ATP, H+ is pumped into the thylakoid space, and a backflow of H+ through an ATP synthase then produces the ATP in the chloroplast stroma. This ATP is used in conjunction with the NADPH made by photosynthesis to drive a large number of biosynthetic reactions in the chloroplast stroma, including the all-important carbon-fixation cycle, which creates carbohydrate from CO2. Along with some other important chloroplast products, this carbohydrate is exported to the cell cytosol, where—as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate—it provides organic carbon, ATP, and reducing power to the rest of the cell.",

These compounds are used to provide both the carbon skeletons for biosynthesis and the metabolic energy that drives cellular processes. It is believed that the first organisms on the primitive Earth had access to an abundance of the organic compounds produced by geochemical processes, but that most of these original compounds were used up billions of years ago. Since that time, the vast majority of the organic materials required by living cells have been produced by photosynthetic organisms, including many types of photosynthetic bacteria.The most advanced photosynthetic bacteria are the cyanobacteria, which have minimal nutrient requirements. They use electrons from water and the energy of sunlight when they convert atmospheric CO2 into organic compounds—a process called carbon fixation. In the course of splitting water [in the overall reaction nH2O + nCO2 (CH2O)n + nO2], they also liberate into the atmosphere the oxygen required for oxidative phosphorylation. As we see in this section, it is thought that the evolution of cyanobacteria from more primitive photosynthetic bacteria eventually made possible the development of abundant aerobic life forms.In plants and algae, which developed much later, photosynthesis occurs in a specialized intracellular organelle—the chloroplast. Chloroplasts perform photosynthesis during the daylight hours. The immediate products of photosynthesis, NADPH and ATP, are used by the photosynthetic cells to produce many organic molecules. In plants, the products include a low-molecular-weight sugar (usually sucrose) that is exported to meet the metabolic needs of the many nonphotosynthetic cells of the organism.Biochemical and genetic evidence strongly suggest that chloroplasts are descendants of oxygen-producing photosynthetic bacteria that were endocytosed and lived in symbiosis with primitive eucaryotic cells. Mitochondria are also generally believed to be descended from an endocytosed bacterium. The many differences between chloroplasts and mitochondria are thought to reflect their different bacterial ancestors, as well as their subsequent evolutionary divergence. Nevertheless, the fundamental mechanisms involved in light-driven ATP synthesis in chloroplasts are very similar to those that we have already discussed for respiration-driven ATP synthesis in mitochondria.The Chloroplast Is One Member of the Plastid Family of OrganellesChloroplasts are the most prominent members of the plastid family of organelles. Plastids are present in all living plant cells, each cell type having its own characteristic complement. All plastids share certain features. Most notably, all plastids in a particular plant species contain multiple copies of the same relatively small genome. In addition, each is enclosed by an envelope composed of two concentric membranes.As discussed in Chapter 12 (see Figure 12-3), all plastids develop from proplastids, small organelles in the immature cells of plant meristems (Figure 14-33A). Proplastids develop according to the requirements of each differentiated cell, and the type that is present is determined in large part by the nuclear genome. If a leaf is grown in darkness, its proplastids enlarge and develop into etioplasts, which have a semicrystalline array of internal membranes containing a yellow chlorophyll precursor instead of chlorophyll. When exposed to light, the etioplasts rapidly develop into chloroplasts by converting this precursor to chlorophyll and by synthesizing new membrane pigments, photosynthetic enzymes, and components of the electron-transport chain. Figure 14-33Plastid diversity. (A) A proplastid from a root tip cell of a bean plant. Note the double membrane; the inner membrane has also generated the relatively sparse internal membranes present. (B) Three amyloplasts (a form of leucoplast), or starch-storing (more...) Leucoplasts are plastids present in many epidermal and internal tissues that do not become green and photosynthetic. They are little more than enlarged proplastids. A common form of leucoplast is the amyloplast (Figure 14-33B), which accumulates the polysaccharide starch in storage tissues—a source of sugar for future use. In some plants, such as potatoes, the amyloplasts can grow to be as large as an average animal cell.It is important to realize that plastids are not just sites for photosynthesis and the deposition of storage materials. Plants have also used their plastids to compartmentalize their intermediary metabolism. Purine and pyrimidine synthesis, most amino acid synthesis, and all of the fatty acid synthesis of plants takes place in the plastids, whereas in animal cells these compounds are produced in the cytosol.Chloroplasts Resemble Mitochondria But Have an Extra CompartmentChloroplasts carry out their energy interconversions by chemiosmotic mechanisms in much the same way that mitochondria do. Although much larger (Figure 14-34A), they are organized on the same principles. They have a highly permeable outer membrane; a much less permeable inner membrane, in which membrane transport proteins are embedded; and a narrow intermembrane space in between. Together, these membranes form the chloroplast envelope (Figure 14-34B,C). The inner membrane surrounds a large space called the stroma, which is analogous to the mitochondrial matrix and contains many metabolic enzymes. Like the mitochondrion, the chloroplast has its own genome and genetic system. The stroma therefore also contains a special set of ribosomes, RNAs, and the chloroplast DNA. Figure 14-34Electron micrographs of chloroplasts. (A) In a wheat leaf cell, a thin rim of cytoplasm—containing chloroplasts, the nucleus, and mitochondria—surrounds a large vacuole. (B) A thin section of a single chloroplast, showing the chloroplast (more...)There is, however, an important difference between the organization of mitochondria and that of chloroplasts. The inner membrane of the chloroplast is not folded into cristae and does not contain electron-transport chains. Instead, the electron-transport chains, photosynthetic light-capturing systems, and ATP synthase are all contained in the thylakoid membrane, a third distinct membrane that forms a set of flattened disclike sacs, the thylakoids (Figure 14-35). The lumen of each thylakoid is thought to be connected with the lumen of other thylakoids, thereby defining a third internal compartment called the thylakoid space, which is separated by the thylakoid membrane from the stroma that surrounds it. Figure 14-35The chloroplast. This photosynthetic organelle contains three distinct membranes (the outer membrane, the inner membrane, and the thylakoid membrane) that define three separate internal compartments (the intermembrane space, the stroma, and the thylakoid (more...)The structural similarities and differences between mitochondria and chloroplasts are illustrated in Figure 14-36. The head of the chloroplast ATP synthase, where ATP is made, protrudes from the thylakoid membrane into the stroma, whereas it protrudes into the matrix from the inner mitochondrial membrane. Figure 14-36A mitochondrion and chloroplast compared. A chloroplast is generally much larger than a mitochondrion and contains, in addition to an outer and inner membrane, a thylakoid membrane enclosing a thylakoid space. Unlike the chloroplast inner membrane, the (more...)Chloroplasts Capture Energy from Sunlight and Use It to Fix CarbonThe many reactions that occur during photosynthesis in plants can be grouped into two broad categories: 1.In the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions (also called the “light reactions”), energy derived from sunlight energizes an electron in the green organic pigment chlorophyll, enabling the electron to move along an electron-transport chain in the thylakoid membrane in much the same way that an electron moves along the respiratory chain in mitochondria. The chlorophyll obtains its electrons from water (H2O), producing O2 as a by-product. During the electron-transport process, H+ is pumped across the thylakoid membrane, and the resulting electrochemical proton gradient drives the synthesis of ATP in the stroma. As the final step in this series of reactions, high-energy electrons are loaded (together with H+) onto NADP+, converting it to NADPH. All of these reactions are confined to the chloroplast.2.In the carbon-fixation reactions (also called the “dark reactions”), the ATP and the NADPH produced by the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions serve as the source of energy and reducing power, respectively, to drive the conversion of CO2 to carbohydrate. The carbon-fixation reactions, which begin in the chloroplast stroma and continue in the cytosol, produce sucrose and many other organic molecules in the leaves of the plant. The sucrose is exported to other tissues as a source of both organic molecules and energy for growth. Thus, the formation of ATP, NADPH, and O2 (which requires light energy directly) and the conversion of CO2 to carbohydrate (which requires light energy only indirectly) are separate processes (Figure 14-37), although elaborate feedback mechanisms interconnect the two. Several of the chloroplast enzymes required for carbon fixation, for example, are inactivated in the dark and reactivated by light-stimulated electron-transport processes. Figure 14-37The reactions of photosynthesis in a chloroplast. Water is oxidized and oxygen is released in the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions, while carbon dioxide is assimilated (fixed) to produce sugars and a variety of other organic molecules in the (more...)Carbon Fixation Is Catalyzed by Ribulose Bisphosphate CarboxylaseWe have seen earlier in this chapter how cells produce ATP by using the large amount of free energy released when carbohydrates are oxidized to CO2 and H2O. Clearly, therefore, the reverse reaction, in which CO2 and H2O combine to make carbohydrate, must be a very unfavorable one that can only occur if it is coupled to other, very favorable reactions that drive it.The central reaction of carbon fixation, in which an atom of inorganic carbon is converted to organic carbon, is illustrated in Figure 14-38: CO2 from the atmosphere combines with the five-carbon compound ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate plus water to yield two molecules of the three-carbon compound 3-phosphoglycerate. This “carbon-fixing” reaction, which was discovered in 1948, is catalyzed in the chloroplast stroma by a large enzyme called ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. Since each molecule of the complex works sluggishly (processing only about 3 molecules of substrate per second compared to 1000 molecules per second for a typical enzyme), many enzyme molecules are needed. Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase often constitutes more than 50% of the total chloroplast protein, and it is thought to be the most abundant protein on Earth. Figure 14-38The initial reaction in carbon fixation. This reaction, in which carbon dioxide is converted into organic carbon, is catalyzed in the chloroplast stroma by the abundant enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. The product is 3-phosphoglycerate, which (more...)Three Molecules of ATP and Two Molecules of NADPH Are Consumed for Each CO2 Molecule That Is FixedThe actual reaction in which CO2 is fixed is energetically favorable because of the reactivity of the energy-rich compound ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, to which each molecule of CO2 is added (see Figure 14-38). The elaborate metabolic pathway that produces ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate requires both NADPH and ATP; it was worked out in one of the first successful applications of radioisotopes as tracers in biochemistry. This carbon-fixation cycle (also called the Calvin cycle) is outlined in Figure 14-39. It starts when 3 molecules of CO2 are fixed by ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase to produce 6 molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (containing 6 × 3 = 18 carbon atoms in all: 3 from the CO2 and 15 from ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate). The 18 carbon atoms then undergo a cycle of reactions that regenerates the 3 molecules of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate used in the initial carbon-fixation step (containing 3 × 5 = 15 carbon atoms). This leaves 1 molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (3 carbon atoms) as the net gain. Figure 14-39The carbon-fixation cycle, which forms organic molecules from CO2 and H2O. The number of carbon atoms in each type of molecule is indicated in the white box. There are many intermediates between glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and ribulose 5-phosphate, but (more...)A total of 3 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of NADPH are consumed for each CO2 molecule converted into carbohydrate. The net equation is: Thus, both phosphate-bond energy (as ATP) and reducing power (as NADPH) are required for the formation of organic molecules from CO2 and H2O. We return to this important point later.The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced in chloroplasts by the carbon-fixation cycle is a three-carbon sugar that also serves as a central intermediate in glycolysis. Much of it is exported to the cytosol, where it can be converted into fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate by the reversal of several reactions in glycolysis (see Panel 2-8, pp. 124–125). The glucose 1-phosphate is then converted to the sugar nucleotide UDP-glucose, and this combines with the fructose 6-phosphate to form sucrose phosphate, the immediate precursor of the disaccharide sucrose. Sucrose is the major form in which sugar is transported between plant cells: just as glucose is transported in the blood of animals, sucrose is exported from the leaves via vascular bundles, providing the carbohydrate required by the rest of the plant.Most of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate that remains in the chloroplast is converted to starch in the stroma. Like glycogen in animal cells, starch is a large polymer of glucose that serves as a carbohydrate reserve (see Figure 14-33B). The production of starch is regulated so that it is produced and stored as large grains in the chloroplast stroma during periods of excess photosynthetic capacity. This occurs through reactions in the stroma that are the reverse of those in glycolysis: they convert glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to glucose 1-phosphate, which is then used to produce the sugar nucleotide ADP-glucose, the immediate precursor of starch. At night the starch is broken down to help support the metabolic needs of the plant. Starch provides an important part of the diet of all animals that eat plants.Carbon Fixation in Some Plants Is Compartmentalized to Facilitate Growth at Low CO2 ConcentrationsAlthough ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase preferentially adds CO2 to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, it can use O2 as a substrate in place of CO2, and if the concentration of CO2 is low, it will add O2 to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate instead (see Figure 14-38). This is the first step in a pathway called photorespiration, whose ultimate effect is to use up O2 and liberate CO2 without the production of useful energy stores. In many plants, about one-third of the CO2 fixed is lost again as CO2 because of photorespiration.Photorespiration can be a serious liability for plants in hot, dry conditions, which cause them to close their stomata (the gas exchange pores in their leaves) to avoid excessive water loss. This in turn causes the CO2 levels in the leaf to fall precipitously, thereby favoring photorespiration. A special adaptation, however, occurs in the leaves of many plants, such as corn and sugar cane that live in hot, dry environments. In these plants, the carbon-fixation cycle occurs only in the chloroplasts of specialized bundle-sheath cells, which contain all of the plant's ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. These cells are protected from the air and are surrounded by a specialized layer of mesophyll cells that use the energy harvested by their chloroplasts to “pump” CO2 into the bundle-sheath cells. This supplies the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase with a high concentration of CO2, thereby greatly reducing photorespiration.The CO2 pump is produced by a reaction cycle that begins in the cytosol of the mesophyll cells. A CO2-fixation step is catalyzed by an enzyme that binds carbon dioxide (as bicarbonate) and combines it with an activated three-carbon molecule to produce a four-carbon molecule. The four-carbon molecule diffuses into the bundle-sheath cells, where it is broken down to release the CO2 and generate a molecule with three carbons. The pumping cycle is completed when this three-carbon molecule is returned to the mesophyll cells and converted back to its original activated form. Because the CO2 is initially captured by converting it into a compound containing four carbons, the CO2-pumping plants are called C4 plants. All other plants are called C3 plants because they capture CO2 into the three-carbon compound 3-phosphoglycerate (Figure 14-40). Figure 14-40Comparative leaf anatomy in a C3 plant and a C4 plant. The cells with green cytosol in the leaf interior contain chloroplasts that perform the normal carbon-fixation cycle. In C4 plants, the mesophyll cells are specialized for CO2 pumping rather than (more...)As for any vectorial transport process, pumping CO2 into the bundle-sheath cells in C4 plants costs energy. In hot, dry environments, however, this cost can be much less than the energy lost by photorespiration in C3 plants, so C4 plants have a potential advantage. Moreover, because C4 plants can perform photosynthesis at a lower concentration of CO2 inside the leaf, they need to open their stomata less often and therefore can fix about twice as much net carbon as C3 plants per unit of water lost. Although the vast majority of plant species are C3 plants, C4 plants such as corn and sugar cane are much more effective at converting sunlight energy into biomass than C3 plants such as cereal grains. They are therefore of special importance in world agriculture.Photosynthesis Depends on the Photochemistry of Chlorophyll MoleculesHaving discussed the carbon-fixation reactions, we now return to the question of how the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions in the chloroplast generate the ATP and the NADPH needed to drive the production of carbohydrates from CO2 and H2O. The required energy is derived from sunlight absorbed by chlorophyll molecules (Figure 14-41). The process of energy conversion begins when a chlorophyll molecule is excited by a quantum of light (a photon) and an electron is moved from one molecular orbital to another of higher energy. As illustrated in Figure 14-42, such an excited molecule is unstable and tends to return to its original, unexcited state in one of three ways: Figure 14-41The structure of chlorophyll. A magnesium atom is held in a porphyrin ring, which is related to the porphyrin ring that binds iron in heme (see Figure 14-22). Electrons are delocalized over the bonds shown in blue. Figure 14-42Three ways for an excited chlorophyll molecule to return to its original, unexcited state. The light energy absorbed by an isolated chlorophyll molecule is completely released as light and heat by process 1. In photosynthesis, by contrast, chlorophylls (more...) 1.By converting the extra energy into heat (molecular motions) or to some combination of heat and light of a longer wavelength (fluorescence), which is what happens when light energy is absorbed by an isolated chlorophyll molecule in solution.2.By transferring the energy—but not the electron—directly to a neighboring chlorophyll molecule by a process called resonance energy transfer.3.By transferring the high-energy electron to another nearby molecule, an electron acceptor, and then returning to its original state by taking up a low-energy electron from some other molecule, an electron donor. The last two mechanisms are exploited in the process of photosynthesis.A Photosystem Consists of a Reaction Center Plus an Antenna ComplexMultiprotein complexes called photosystems catalyze the conversion of the light energy captured in excited chlorophyll molecules to useful forms. A photosystem consists of two closely linked components: an antenna complex, consisting of a large set of pigment molecules that capture light energy and feed it to the reaction center; and a photochemical reaction center, consisting of a complex of proteins and chlorophyll molecules that enable light energy to be converted into chemical energy (Figure 14-43). Figure 14-43The antenna complex and photochemical reaction center in a photosystem. The antenna complex is a collector of light energy in the form of excited electrons. The energy of the excited electrons is funneled, through a series of resonance energy transfers, (more...)The antenna complex is important for capturing light. In chloroplasts it consists of a number of distinct membrane protein complexes (known as light-harvesting complexes); together, these proteins bind several hundred chlorophyll molecules per reaction center, orienting them precisely in the thylakoid membrane. Depending on the plant, different amounts of accessory pigments called carotenoids, which protect the chlorophylls from oxidation and can help collect light of other wavelengths, are also located in each complex. When a chlorophyll molecule in the antenna complex is excited, the energy is rapidly transferred from one molecule to another by resonance energy transfer until it reaches a special pair of chlorophyll molecules in the photochemical reaction center. Each antenna complex thereby acts as a funnel, collecting light energy and directing it to a specific site where it can be used effectively (see Figure 14-43).The photochemical reaction center is a transmembrane protein-pigment complex that lies at the heart of photosynthesis. It is thought to have evolved more than 3 billion years ago in primitive photosynthetic bacteria. The special pair of chlorophyll molecules in the reaction center acts as an irreversible trap for excitation quanta because its excited electron is immediately passed to a chain of electron acceptors that are precisely positioned as neighbors in the same protein complex (Figure 14-44). By moving the high-energy electron rapidly away from the chlorophylls, the photochemical reaction center transfers it to an environment where it is much more stable. The electron is thereby suitably positioned for subsequent reactions, which require more time to complete. Figure 14-44The arrangement of the electron carriers in a bacterial photochemical reaction center, as determined by x-ray crystallography.

An enormous amount of detailed information is available for the photosystem of purple bacteria, which is somewhat simpler than the evolutionarily related photosystems in chloroplasts. The reaction center in this photosystem is a large protein-pigment complex that can be solubilized with detergent and purified in active form. In 1985, its complete three-dimensional structure was determined by x-ray crystallography (see Figure 10-38). This structure, combined with kinetic data, provides the best picture we have of the initial electron-transfer reactions that underlie photosynthesis.The sequence of electron transfers that take place in the reaction center of purple bacteria is shown in Figure 14-45. As outlined previously for the general case (see Figure 14-43), light causes a net electron transfer from a weak electron donor (a molecule with a strong affinity for electrons) to a molecule that is a strong electron donor in its reduced form. The excitation energy in chlorophyll that would normally be released as fluorescence or heat is thereby used instead to create a strong electron donor (a molecule carrying a high-energy electron) where none had been before. In the purple bacterium, the weak electron donor used to fill the electron-deficient hole created by a light-induced charge separation is a cytochrome (see orange box in Figure 14-45); the strong electron donor produced is a quinone. In the chloroplasts of higher plants, a quinone is similarly produced. However, as we discuss next, water serves as the initial weak electron donor, which is why oxygen gas is released by photosynthesis in plants. Figure 14-45The electron transfers that occur in the photochemical reaction center of a purple bacterium. A similar set of reactions occurs in the evolutionarily related photosystem II in plants. At the top left is an orientating diagram showing the molecules that (more...)Noncyclic Photophosphorylation Produces Both NADPH and ATPPhotosynthesis in plants and cyanobacteria produces both ATP and NADPH directly by a two-step process called noncyclic photophosphorylation. Because two photosystems—called photosystems I and II—are used in series to energize an electron, the electron can be transferred all the way from water to NADPH. As the high-energy electrons pass through the coupled photosystems to generate NADPH, some of their energy is siphoned off for ATP synthesis.The first of the two photosystems—paradoxically called photosystem II for historical reasons—has the unique ability to withdraw electrons from water. The oxygens of two water molecules bind to a cluster of manganese atoms in a poorly understood water-splitting enzyme. This enzyme enables electrons to be removed one at a time from the water, as required to fill the electron-deficient holes created by light in chlorophyll molecules in the reaction center. As soon as four electrons have been removed from the two water molecules (requiring four quanta of light), O2 is released. Photosystem II thus catalyzes the reaction 2H2O + 4 photons → 4H+ + 4e - + O2. As we discussed for the electron-transport chain in mitochondria, which uses O2 and produces water, the mechanism ensures that no partly oxidized water molecules are released as dangerous, highly reactive oxygen radicals. Essentially all the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere has been produced in this way.The core of the reaction center in photosystem II is homologous to the bacterial reaction center just described, and it likewise produces strong electron donors in the form of reduced quinone molecules dissolved in the lipid bilayer of the membrane. The quinones pass their electrons to a H+ pump called the cytochrome b6-f complex, which resembles the cytochrome b-c1 complex in the respiratory chain of mitochondria. The cytochrome b6-f complex pumps H+ into the thylakoid space across the thylakoid membrane (or out of the cytosol across the plasma membrane in cyanobacteria), and the resulting electrochemical gradient drives the synthesis of ATP by an ATP synthase (Figure 14-46). Figure 14-46Electron flow during photosynthesis in the thylakoid membrane. The mobile electron carriers in the chain are plastoquinone (which closely resembles the ubiquinone of mitochondria), plastocyanin (a small copper-containing protein), and ferredoxin (a small (more...)The final electron acceptor in this electron-transport chain is the second photosystem, photosystem I, which accepts an electron into the electron-deficient hole created by light in the chlorophyll molecule in its reaction center. Each electron that enters photosystem I is finally boosted to a very high-energy level that allows it to be passed to the iron-sulfur center in ferredoxin and then to NADP+ to generate NADPH (Figure 14-47). Figure 14-47Changes in redox potential during photosynthesis. The redox potential for each molecule is indicated by its position along the vertical axis. In photosystem II, the excited reaction center chlorophyll has a redox potential high enough to withdraw electrons (more...)The scheme for photosynthesis just discussed is known as the Z scheme. By means of its two electron-energizing steps, one catalyzed by each photosystem, an electron is passed from water, which normally holds on to its electrons very tightly (redox potential = +820 mV), to NADPH, which normally holds on to its electrons loosely (redox potential = -320 mV). There is not enough energy in a single quantum of visible light to energize an electron all the way from the bottom of photosystem II to the top of photosystem I, which is presumably the energy change required to pass an electron efficiently from water to NADP+. The use of two separate photosystems in series means that the energy from two quanta of light is available for this purpose. In addition, there is enough energy left over to enable the electron-transport chain that links the two photosystems to pump H+ across the thylakoid membrane (or the plasma membrane of cyanobacteria), so that the ATP synthase can harness some of the light-derived energy for ATP production.Chloroplasts Can Make ATP by Cyclic Photophosphorylation Without Making NADPHIn the noncyclic photophosphorylation scheme just discussed, high-energy electrons leaving photosystem II are harnessed to generate ATP and are passed on to photosystem I to drive the production of NADPH. This produces slightly more than 1 molecule of ATP for every pair of electrons that passes from H2O to NADP+ to generate a molecule of NADPH. But 1.5 molecules of ATP per NADPH are needed for carbon fixation (see Figure 14-39). To produce extra ATP, the chloroplasts in some species of plants can switch photosystem I into a cyclic mode so that it produces ATP instead of NADPH. In this process, called cyclic photophosphorylation, the high-energy electrons from photosystem I are transferred to the cytochrome b6-f complex rather than being passed on to NADP+. From the b6-f complex, the electrons are passed back to photosystem I at a low energy. The only net result, besides the conversion of some light energy to heat, is that H+ is pumped across the thylakoid membrane by the b6-f complex as electrons pass through it, thereby increasing the electrochemical proton gradient that drives the ATP synthase. (This is analogous to the right side of the diagram for purple nonsulfur bacteria in Figure 14-71, below.) To summarize, cyclic photophosphorylation involves only photosystem I, and it produces ATP without the formation of either NADPH or O2. The relative activities of cyclic and noncyclic electron flows can be regulated by the cell to determine how much light energy is converted into reducing power (NADPH) and how much into high-energy phosphate bonds (ATP).Photosystems I and II Have Related Structures, and Also Resemble Bacterial PhotosystemsThe mechanisms of fundamental cell processes such as DNA replication or respiration generally turn out to be the same in eucaryotic cells and in bacteria, even though the number of protein components involved is considerably greater in eucaryotes. Eucaryotes evolved from procaryotes, and the additional proteins presumably were selected for during evolution because they provided an extra degree of efficiency and/or regulation that was useful to the cell.Photosystems provide a clear example of this type of evolution. Photosystem II, for example, is formed from more than 25 different protein subunits, creating a large assembly in the thylakoid membrane with a mass of about 1 million daltons. The atomic structures of the eucaryotic photosystems are being revealed by a combination of electron and x-ray crystallography. The task is difficult because the complexes are large and embedded in the lipid bilayer. Nevertheless, as illustrated in Figure 14-48, the close relationship of photosystem I, photosystem II, and the photochemical reaction center of purple bacteria has been clearly demonstrated from these atomic-level analyses. Figure 14-48Three types of photosynthetic reaction centers compared. Pigments involved in light harvesting are colored green; those involved in the central photochemical events are colored red. (A) The photochemical reaction center of purple bacteria, whose detailed (more...)The Proton-Motive Force Is the Same in Mitochondria and ChloroplastsThe presence of the thylakoid space separates a chloroplast into three rather than the two internal compartments of a mitochondrion. The net effect of H+ translocation in the two organelles is, however, similar. As illustrated in Figure 14-49, in chloroplasts, H+ is pumped out of the stroma (pH 8) into the thylakoid space (pH ~5), creating a gradient of 3–3.5 pH units. This represents a proton-motive force of about 200 mV across the thylakoid membrane, and it drives ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase embedded in this membrane. The force is the same as that across the inner mitochondrial membrane, but nearly all of it is contributed by the pH gradient rather than by a membrane potential, unlike the case in mitochondria. Figure 14-49A comparison of the flow of H+ and the orientation of the ATP synthase in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Those compartments with similar pH values have been colored the same. The proton-motive force across the thylakoid membrane consists almost entirely (more...)Like the stroma, the mitochondrial matrix has a pH of about 8. This is created by pumping H+ out of the mitochondrion into the cytosol (pH ~7) rather than into an interior space in the organelle. Thus, the pH gradient is relatively small, and most of the proton-motive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane is instead caused by the resulting membrane potential (see Figure 14-13).For both mitochondria and chloroplasts, the catalytic site of the ATP synthase is at a pH of about 8 and is located in a large organelle compartment (matrix or stroma) that is packed full of soluble enzymes. Consequently, it is here that all of the organelle's ATP is made (see Figure 14-49).Carrier Proteins in the Chloroplast Inner Membrane Control Metabolite Exchange with the CytosolIf chloroplasts are isolated in a way that leaves their inner membrane intact, this membrane can be shown to have a selective permeability, reflecting the presence of specific carrier proteins. Most notably, much of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced by CO2 fixation in the chloroplast stroma is transported out of the chloroplast by an efficient antiport system that exchanges three-carbon sugar phosphates for an inward flux of inorganic phosphate.Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate normally provides the cytosol with an abundant source of carbohydrate, which is used by the cell as the starting point for many other biosyntheses—including the production of sucrose for export. But this is not all that this molecule provides. Once the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate reaches the cytosol, it is readily converted (by part of the glycolytic pathway) to 1,3-phosphoglycerate and then 3-phosphoglycerate (see p. 97), generating one molecule of ATP and one of NADH. (A similar two-step reaction, but working in reverse, forms glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the carbon-fixation cycle; see Figure 14-39.) As a result, the export of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate from the chloroplast provides not only the main source of fixed carbon to the rest of the cell, but also the reducing power and ATP needed for metabolism outside the chloroplast.Chloroplasts Also Perform Other Crucial BiosynthesesThe chloroplast performs many biosyntheses in addition to photosynthesis. All of the cell's fatty acids and a number of amino acids, for example, are made by enzymes in the chloroplast stroma. Similarly, the reducing power of light-activated electrons drives the reduction of nitrite (NO2-) to ammonia (NH3) in the chloroplast; this ammonia provides the plant with nitrogen for the synthesis of amino acids and nucleotides. The metabolic importance of the chloroplast for plants and algae therefore extends far beyond its role in photosynthesis.SummaryChloroplasts and photosynthetic bacteria obtain high-energy electrons by means of photosystems that capture the electrons that are excited when sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules. Photosystems are composed of an antenna complex that funnels energy to a photochemical reaction center, where a precisely ordered complex of proteins and pigments allows the energy of an excited electron in chlorophyll to be captured by electron carriers. The best-understood photochemical reaction center is that of purple photosynthetic bacteria, which contain only a single photosystem. In contrast, there are two distinct photosystems in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. The two photosystems are normally linked in series, and they transfer electrons from water to NADP+ to form NADPH, with the concomitant production of a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient. In these linked photosystems, molecular oxygen (O2) is generated as a by-product of removing four low-energy electrons from two specifically positioned water molecules.Compared with mitochondria, chloroplasts have an additional internal membrane (the thylakoid membrane) and a third internal space (the thylakoid space). All electron-transport processes occur in the thylakoid membrane: to make ATP, H+ is pumped into the thylakoid space, and a backflow of H+ through an ATP synthase then produces the ATP in the chloroplast stroma. This ATP is used in conjunction with the NADPH made by photosynthesis to drive a large number of biosynthetic reactions in the chloroplast stroma, including the all-important carbon-fixation cycle, which creates carbohydrate from CO2. Along with some other important chloroplast products, this carbohydrate is exported to the cell cytosol, where—as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate—it provides organic carbon, ATP, and reducing power to the rest of the cell.

These compounds are used to provide both the carbon skeletons for biosynthesis and the metabolic energy that drives cellular processes. It is believed that the first organisms on the primitive Earth had access to an abundance of the organic compounds produced by geochemical processes, but that most of these original compounds were used up billions of years ago. Since that time, the vast majority of the organic materials required by living cells have been produced by photosynthetic organisms, including many types of photosynthetic bacteria.The most advanced photosynthetic bacteria are the cyanobacteria, which have minimal nutrient requirements. They use electrons from water and the energy of sunlight when they convert atmospheric CO2 into organic compounds—a process called carbon fixation. In the course of splitting water [in the overall reaction nH2O + nCO2 (CH2O)n + nO2], they also liberate into the atmosphere the oxygen required for oxidative phosphorylation. As we see in this section, it is thought that the evolution of cyanobacteria from more primitive photosynthetic bacteria eventually made possible the development of abundant aerobic life forms.In plants and algae, which developed much later, photosynthesis occurs in a specialized intracellular organelle—the chloroplast. Chloroplasts perform photosynthesis during the daylight hours. The immediate products of photosynthesis, NADPH and ATP, are used by the photosynthetic cells to produce many organic molecules. In plants, the products include a low-molecular-weight sugar (usually sucrose) that is exported to meet the metabolic needs of the many nonphotosynthetic cells of the organism.Biochemical and genetic evidence strongly suggest that chloroplasts are descendants of oxygen-producing photosynthetic bacteria that were endocytosed and lived in symbiosis with primitive eucaryotic cells. Mitochondria are also generally believed to be descended from an endocytosed bacterium. The many differences between chloroplasts and mitochondria are thought to reflect their different bacterial ancestors, as well as their subsequent evolutionary divergence. Nevertheless, the fundamental mechanisms involved in light-driven ATP synthesis in chloroplasts are very similar to those that we have already discussed for respiration-driven ATP synthesis in mitochondria.The Chloroplast Is One Member of the Plastid Family of OrganellesChloroplasts are the most prominent members of the plastid family of organelles. Plastids are present in all living plant cells, each cell type having its own characteristic complement. All plastids share certain features. Most notably, all plastids in a particular plant species contain multiple copies of the same relatively small genome. In addition, each is enclosed by an envelope composed of two concentric membranes.As discussed in Chapter 12 (see Figure 12-3), all plastids develop from proplastids, small organelles in the immature cells of plant meristems (Figure 14-33A). Proplastids develop according to the requirements of each differentiated cell, and the type that is present is determined in large part by the nuclear genome. If a leaf is grown in darkness, its proplastids enlarge and develop into etioplasts, which have a semicrystalline array of internal membranes containing a yellow chlorophyll precursor instead of chlorophyll. When exposed to light, the etioplasts rapidly develop into chloroplasts by converting this precursor to chlorophyll and by synthesizing new membrane pigments, photosynthetic enzymes, and components of the electron-transport chain. Figure 14-33Plastid diversity. (A) A proplastid from a root tip cell of a bean plant. Note the double membrane; the inner membrane has also generated the relatively sparse internal membranes present. (B) Three amyloplasts (a form of leucoplast), or starch-storing (more...) Leucoplasts are plastids present in many epidermal and internal tissues that do not become green and photosynthetic. They are little more than enlarged proplastids. A common form of leucoplast is the amyloplast (Figure 14-33B), which accumulates the polysaccharide starch in storage tissues—a source of sugar for future use. In some plants, such as potatoes, the amyloplasts can grow to be as large as an average animal cell.It is important to realize that plastids are not just sites for photosynthesis and the deposition of storage materials. Plants have also used their plastids to compartmentalize their intermediary metabolism. Purine and pyrimidine synthesis, most amino acid synthesis, and all of the fatty acid synthesis of plants takes place in the plastids, whereas in animal cells these compounds are produced in the cytosol.Chloroplasts Resemble Mitochondria But Have an Extra CompartmentChloroplasts carry out their energy interconversions by chemiosmotic mechanisms in much the same way that mitochondria do. Although much larger (Figure 14-34A), they are organized on the same principles. They have a highly permeable outer membrane; a much less permeable inner membrane, in which membrane transport proteins are embedded; and a narrow intermembrane space in between. Together, these membranes form the chloroplast envelope (Figure 14-34B,C). The inner membrane surrounds a large space called the stroma, which is analogous to the mitochondrial matrix and contains many metabolic enzymes. Like the mitochondrion, the chloroplast has its own genome and genetic system. The stroma therefore also contains a special set of ribosomes, RNAs, and the chloroplast DNA. Figure 14-34Electron micrographs of chloroplasts. (A) In a wheat leaf cell, a thin rim of cytoplasm—containing chloroplasts, the nucleus, and mitochondria—surrounds a large vacuole. (B) A thin section of a single chloroplast, showing the chloroplast (more...)There is, however, an important difference between the organization of mitochondria and that of chloroplasts. The inner membrane of the chloroplast is not folded into cristae and does not contain electron-transport chains. Instead, the electron-transport chains, photosynthetic light-capturing systems, and ATP synthase are all contained in the thylakoid membrane, a third distinct membrane that forms a set of flattened disclike sacs, the thylakoids (Figure 14-35). The lumen of each thylakoid is thought to be connected with the lumen of other thylakoids, thereby defining a third internal compartment called the thylakoid space, which is separated by the thylakoid membrane from the stroma that surrounds it. Figure 14-35The chloroplast. This photosynthetic organelle contains three distinct membranes (the outer membrane, the inner membrane, and the thylakoid membrane) that define three separate internal compartments (the intermembrane space, the stroma, and the thylakoid (more...)The structural similarities and differences between mitochondria and chloroplasts are illustrated in Figure 14-36. The head of the chloroplast ATP synthase, where ATP is made, protrudes from the thylakoid membrane into the stroma, whereas it protrudes into the matrix from the inner mitochondrial membrane. Figure 14-36A mitochondrion and chloroplast compared. A chloroplast is generally much larger than a mitochondrion and contains, in addition to an outer and inner membrane, a thylakoid membrane enclosing a thylakoid space. Unlike the chloroplast inner membrane, the (more...)Chloroplasts Capture Energy from Sunlight and Use It to Fix CarbonThe many reactions that occur during photosynthesis in plants can be grouped into two broad categories: 1.In the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions (also called the “light reactions”), energy derived from sunlight energizes an electron in the green organic pigment chlorophyll, enabling the electron to move along an electron-transport chain in the thylakoid membrane in much the same way that an electron moves along the respiratory chain in mitochondria. The chlorophyll obtains its electrons from water (H2O), producing O2 as a by-product. During the electron-transport process, H+ is pumped across the thylakoid membrane, and the resulting electrochemical proton gradient drives the synthesis of ATP in the stroma. As the final step in this series of reactions, high-energy electrons are loaded (together with H+) onto NADP+, converting it to NADPH. All of these reactions are confined to the chloroplast.2.In the carbon-fixation reactions (also called the “dark reactions”), the ATP and the NADPH produced by the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions serve as the source of energy and reducing power, respectively, to drive the conversion of CO2 to carbohydrate. The carbon-fixation reactions, which begin in the chloroplast stroma and continue in the cytosol, produce sucrose and many other organic molecules in the leaves of the plant. The sucrose is exported to other tissues as a source of both organic molecules and energy for growth. Thus, the formation of ATP, NADPH, and O2 (which requires light energy directly) and the conversion of CO2 to carbohydrate (which requires light energy only indirectly) are separate processes (Figure 14-37), although elaborate feedback mechanisms interconnect the two. Several of the chloroplast enzymes required for carbon fixation, for example, are inactivated in the dark and reactivated by light-stimulated electron-transport processes. Figure 14-37The reactions of photosynthesis in a chloroplast. Water is oxidized and oxygen is released in the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions, while carbon dioxide is assimilated (fixed) to produce sugars and a variety of other organic molecules in the (more...)Carbon Fixation Is Catalyzed by Ribulose Bisphosphate CarboxylaseWe have seen earlier in this chapter how cells produce ATP by using the large amount of free energy released when carbohydrates are oxidized to CO2 and H2O. Clearly, therefore, the reverse reaction, in which CO2 and H2O combine to make carbohydrate, must be a very unfavorable one that can only occur if it is coupled to other, very favorable reactions that drive it.The central reaction of carbon fixation, in which an atom of inorganic carbon is converted to organic carbon, is illustrated in Figure 14-38: CO2 from the atmosphere combines with the five-carbon compound ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate plus water to yield two molecules of the three-carbon compound 3-phosphoglycerate. This “carbon-fixing” reaction, which was discovered in 1948, is catalyzed in the chloroplast stroma by a large enzyme called ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. Since each molecule of the complex works sluggishly (processing only about 3 molecules of substrate per second compared to 1000 molecules per second for a typical enzyme), many enzyme molecules are needed. Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase often constitutes more than 50% of the total chloroplast protein, and it is thought to be the most abundant protein on Earth. Figure 14-38The initial reaction in carbon fixation. This reaction, in which carbon dioxide is converted into organic carbon, is catalyzed in the chloroplast stroma by the abundant enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. The product is 3-phosphoglycerate, which (more...)Three Molecules of ATP and Two Molecules of NADPH Are Consumed for Each CO2 Molecule That Is FixedThe actual reaction in which CO2 is fixed is energetically favorable because of the reactivity of the energy-rich compound ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, to which each molecule of CO2 is added (see Figure 14-38). The elaborate metabolic pathway that produces ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate requires both NADPH and ATP; it was worked out in one of the first successful applications of radioisotopes as tracers in biochemistry. This carbon-fixation cycle (also called the Calvin cycle) is outlined in Figure 14-39. It starts when 3 molecules of CO2 are fixed by ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase to produce 6 molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (containing 6 × 3 = 18 carbon atoms in all: 3 from the CO2 and 15 from ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate). The 18 carbon atoms then undergo a cycle of reactions that regenerates the 3 molecules of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate used in the initial carbon-fixation step (containing 3 × 5 = 15 carbon atoms). This leaves 1 molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (3 carbon atoms) as the net gain. Figure 14-39The carbon-fixation cycle, which forms organic molecules from CO2 and H2O. The number of carbon atoms in each type of molecule is indicated in the white box. There are many intermediates between glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and ribulose 5-phosphate, but (more...)A total of 3 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of NADPH are consumed for each CO2 molecule converted into carbohydrate. The net equation is: Thus, both phosphate-bond energy (as ATP) and reducing power (as NADPH) are required for the formation of organic molecules from CO2 and H2O. We return to this important point later.The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced in chloroplasts by the carbon-fixation cycle is a three-carbon sugar that also serves as a central intermediate in glycolysis. Much of it is exported to the cytosol, where it can be converted into fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate by the reversal of several reactions in glycolysis (see Panel 2-8, pp. 124–125). The glucose 1-phosphate is then converted to the sugar nucleotide UDP-glucose, and this combines with the fructose 6-phosphate to form sucrose phosphate, the immediate precursor of the disaccharide sucrose. Sucrose is the major form in which sugar is transported between plant cells: just as glucose is transported in the blood of animals, sucrose is exported from the leaves via vascular bundles, providing the carbohydrate required by the rest of the plant.Most of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate that remains in the chloroplast is converted to starch in the stroma. Like glycogen in animal cells, starch is a large polymer of glucose that serves as a carbohydrate reserve (see Figure 14-33B). The production of starch is regulated so that it is produced and stored as large grains in the chloroplast stroma during periods of excess photosynthetic capacity. This occurs through reactions in the stroma that are the reverse of those in glycolysis: they convert glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to glucose 1-phosphate, which is then used to produce the sugar nucleotide ADP-glucose, the immediate precursor of starch. At night the starch is broken down to help support the metabolic needs of the plant. Starch provides an important part of the diet of all animals that eat plants.Carbon Fixation in Some Plants Is Compartmentalized to Facilitate Growth at Low CO2 ConcentrationsAlthough ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase preferentially adds CO2 to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, it can use O2 as a substrate in place of CO2, and if the concentration of CO2 is low, it will add O2 to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate instead (see Figure 14-38). This is the first step in a pathway called photorespiration, whose ultimate effect is to use up O2 and liberate CO2 without the production of useful energy stores. In many plants, about one-third of the CO2 fixed is lost again as CO2 because of photorespiration.Photorespiration can be a serious liability for plants in hot, dry conditions, which cause them to close their stomata (the gas exchange pores in their leaves) to avoid excessive water loss. This in turn causes the CO2 levels in the leaf to fall precipitously, thereby favoring photorespiration. A special adaptation, however, occurs in the leaves of many plants, such as corn and sugar cane that live in hot, dry environments. In these plants, the carbon-fixation cycle occurs only in the chloroplasts of specialized bundle-sheath cells, which contain all of the plant's ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. These cells are protected from the air and are surrounded by a specialized layer of mesophyll cells that use the energy harvested by their chloroplasts to “pump” CO2 into the bundle-sheath cells. This supplies the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase with a high concentration of CO2, thereby greatly reducing photorespiration.The CO2 pump is produced by a reaction cycle that begins in the cytosol of the mesophyll cells. A CO2-fixation step is catalyzed by an enzyme that binds carbon dioxide (as bicarbonate) and combines it with an activated three-carbon molecule to produce a four-carbon molecule. The four-carbon molecule diffuses into the bundle-sheath cells, where it is broken down to release the CO2 and generate a molecule with three carbons. The pumping cycle is completed when this three-carbon molecule is returned to the mesophyll cells and converted back to its original activated form. Because the CO2 is initially captured by converting it into a compound containing four carbons, the CO2-pumping plants are called C4 plants. All other plants are called C3 plants because they capture CO2 into the three-carbon compound 3-phosphoglycerate (Figure 14-40). Figure 14-40Comparative leaf anatomy in a C3 plant and a C4 plant. The cells with green cytosol in the leaf interior contain chloroplasts that perform the normal carbon-fixation cycle. In C4 plants, the mesophyll cells are specialized for CO2 pumping rather than (more...)As for any vectorial transport process, pumping CO2 into the bundle-sheath cells in C4 plants costs energy. In hot, dry environments, however, this cost can be much less than the energy lost by photorespiration in C3 plants, so C4 plants have a potential advantage. Moreover, because C4 plants can perform photosynthesis at a lower concentration of CO2 inside the leaf, they need to open their stomata less often and therefore can fix about twice as much net carbon as C3 plants per unit of water lost. Although the vast majority of plant species are C3 plants, C4 plants such as corn and sugar cane are much more effective at converting sunlight energy into biomass than C3 plants such as cereal grains. They are therefore of special importance in world agriculture.Photosynthesis Depends on the Photochemistry of Chlorophyll MoleculesHaving discussed the carbon-fixation reactions, we now return to the question of how the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions in the chloroplast generate the ATP and the NADPH needed to drive the production of carbohydrates from CO2 and H2O. The required energy is derived from sunlight absorbed by chlorophyll molecules (Figure 14-41). The process of energy conversion begins when a chlorophyll molecule is excited by a quantum of light (a photon) and an electron is moved from one molecular orbital to another of higher energy. As illustrated in Figure 14-42, such an excited molecule is unstable and tends to return to its original, unexcited state in one of three ways: Figure 14-41The structure of chlorophyll. A magnesium atom is held in a porphyrin ring, which is related to the porphyrin ring that binds iron in heme (see Figure 14-22). Electrons are delocalized over the bonds shown in blue. Figure 14-42Three ways for an excited chlorophyll molecule to return to its original, unexcited state. The light energy absorbed by an isolated chlorophyll molecule is completely released as light and heat by process 1. In photosynthesis, by contrast, chlorophylls (more...) 1.By converting the extra energy into heat (molecular motions) or to some combination of heat and light of a longer wavelength (fluorescence), which is what happens when light energy is absorbed by an isolated chlorophyll molecule in solution.2.By transferring the energy—but not the electron—directly to a neighboring chlorophyll molecule by a process called resonance energy transfer.3.By transferring the high-energy electron to another nearby molecule, an electron acceptor, and then returning to its original state by taking up a low-energy electron from some other molecule, an electron donor. The last two mechanisms are exploited in the process of photosynthesis.A Photosystem Consists of a Reaction Center Plus an Antenna ComplexMultiprotein complexes called photosystems catalyze the conversion of the light energy captured in excited chlorophyll molecules to useful forms. A photosystem consists of two closely linked components: an antenna complex, consisting of a large set of pigment molecules that capture light energy and feed it to the reaction center; and a photochemical reaction center, consisting of a complex of proteins and chlorophyll molecules that enable light energy to be converted into chemical energy (Figure 14-43). Figure 14-43The antenna complex and photochemical reaction center in a photosystem. The antenna complex is a collector of light energy in the form of excited electrons. The energy of the excited electrons is funneled, through a series of resonance energy transfers, (more...)The antenna complex is important for capturing light. In chloroplasts it consists of a number of distinct membrane protein complexes (known as light-harvesting complexes); together, these proteins bind several hundred chlorophyll molecules per reaction center, orienting them precisely in the thylakoid membrane. Depending on the plant, different amounts of accessory pigments called carotenoids, which protect the chlorophylls from oxidation and can help collect light of other wavelengths, are also located in each complex. When a chlorophyll molecule in the antenna complex is excited, the energy is rapidly transferred from one molecule to another by resonance energy transfer until it reaches a special pair of chlorophyll molecules in the photochemical reaction center. Each antenna complex thereby acts as a funnel, collecting light energy and directing it to a specific site where it can be used effectively (see Figure 14-43).The photochemical reaction center is a transmembrane protein-pigment complex that lies at the heart of photosynthesis. It is thought to have evolved more than 3 billion years ago in primitive photosynthetic bacteria. The special pair of chlorophyll molecules in the reaction center acts as an irreversible trap for excitation quanta because its excited electron is immediately passed to a chain of electron acceptors that are precisely positioned as neighbors in the same protein complex (Figure 14-44). By moving the high-energy electron rapidly away from the chlorophylls, the photochemical reaction center transfers it to an environment where it is much more stable. The electron is thereby suitably positioned for subsequent reactions, which require more time to complete. Figure 14-44The arrangement of the electron carriers in a bacterial photochemical reaction center, as determined by x-ray crystallography. The pigment molecules shown are held in the interior of a transmembrane protein and are surrounded by the lipid bilayer of the (more...)In a Reaction Center, Light Energy Captured by Chlorophyll Creates a Strong Electron Donor from a Weak OneThe electron transfers involved in the photochemical reactions just outlined have been analyzed extensively by rapid spectroscopic methods. An enormous amount of detailed information is available for the photosystem of purple bacteria, which is somewhat simpler than the evolutionarily related photosystems in chloroplasts. The reaction center in this photosystem is a large protein-pigment complex that can be solubilized with detergent and purified in active form. In 1985, its complete three-dimensional structure was determined by x-ray crystallography (see Figure 10-38). This structure, combined with kinetic data, provides the best picture we have of the initial electron-transfer reactions that underlie photosynthesis.The sequence of electron transfers that take place in the reaction center of purple bacteria is shown in Figure 14-45. As outlined previously for the general case (see Figure 14-43), light causes a net electron transfer from a weak electron donor (a molecule with a strong affinity for electrons) to a molecule that is a strong electron donor in its reduced form. The excitation energy in chlorophyll that would normally be released as fluorescence or heat is thereby used instead to create a strong electron donor (a molecule carrying a high-energy electron) where none had been before. In the purple bacterium, the weak electron donor used to fill the electron-deficient hole created by a light-induced charge separation is a cytochrome (see orange box in Figure 14-45); the strong electron donor produced is a quinone. In the chloroplasts of higher plants, a quinone is similarly produced. However, as we discuss next, water serves as the initial weak electron donor, which is why oxygen gas is released by photosynthesis in plants. Figure 14-45The electron transfers that occur in the photochemical reaction center of a purple bacterium. A similar set of reactions occurs in the evolutionarily related photosystem II in plants. At the top left is an orientating diagram showing the molecules that (more...)Noncyclic Photophosphorylation Produces Both NADPH and ATPPhotosynthesis in plants and cyanobacteria produces both ATP and NADPH directly by a two-step process called noncyclic photophosphorylation. Because two photosystems—called photosystems I and II—are used in series to energize an electron, the electron can be transferred all the way from water to NADPH. As the high-energy electrons pass through the coupled photosystems to generate NADPH, some of their energy is siphoned off for ATP synthesis.The first of the two photosystems—paradoxically called photosystem II for historical reasons—has the unique ability to withdraw electrons from water. The oxygens of two water molecules bind to a cluster of manganese atoms in a poorly understood water-splitting enzyme. This enzyme enables electrons to be removed one at a time from the water, as required to fill the electron-deficient holes created by light in chlorophyll molecules in the reaction center. As soon as four electrons have been removed from the two water molecules (requiring four quanta of light), O2 is released. Photosystem II thus catalyzes the reaction 2H2O + 4 photons → 4H+ + 4e - + O2. As we discussed for the electron-transport chain in mitochondria, which uses O2 and produces water, the mechanism ensures that no partly oxidized water molecules are released as dangerous, highly reactive oxygen radicals. Essentially all the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere has been produced in this way.The core of the reaction center in photosystem II is homologous to the bacterial reaction center just described, and it likewise produces strong electron donors in the form of reduced quinone molecules dissolved in the lipid bilayer of the membrane. The quinones pass their electrons to a H+ pump called the cytochrome b6-f complex, which resembles the cytochrome b-c1 complex in the respiratory chain of mitochondria. The cytochrome b6-f complex pumps H+ into the thylakoid space across the thylakoid membrane (or out of the cytosol across the plasma membrane in cyanobacteria), and the resulting electrochemical gradient drives the synthesis of ATP by an ATP synthase (Figure 14-46). Figure 14-46Electron flow during photosynthesis in the thylakoid membrane. The mobile electron carriers in the chain are plastoquinone (which closely resembles the ubiquinone of mitochondria), plastocyanin (a small copper-containing protein), and ferredoxin (a small (more...)The final electron acceptor in this electron-transport chain is the second photosystem, photosystem I, which accepts an electron into the electron-deficient hole created by light in the chlorophyll molecule in its reaction center. Each electron that enters photosystem I is finally boosted to a very high-energy level that allows it to be passed to the iron-sulfur center in ferredoxin and then to NADP+ to generate NADPH (Figure 14-47). Figure 14-47Changes in redox potential during photosynthesis. The redox potential for each molecule is indicated by its position along the vertical axis. In photosystem II, the excited reaction center chlorophyll has a redox potential high enough to withdraw electrons (more...)The scheme for photosynthesis just discussed is known as the Z scheme. By means of its two electron-energizing steps, one catalyzed by each photosystem, an electron is passed from water, which normally holds on to its electrons very tightly (redox potential = +820 mV), to NADPH, which normally holds on to its electrons loosely (redox potential = -320 mV). There is not enough energy in a single quantum of visible light to energize an electron all the way from the bottom of photosystem II to the top of photosystem I, which is presumably the energy change required to pass an electron efficiently from water to NADP+. The use of two separate photosystems in series means that the energy from two quanta of light is available for this purpose. In addition, there is enough energy left over to enable the electron-transport chain that links the two photosystems to pump H+ across the thylakoid membrane (or the plasma membrane of cyanobacteria), so that the ATP synthase can harness some of the light-derived energy for ATP production.Chloroplasts Can Make ATP by Cyclic Photophosphorylation Without Making NADPHIn the noncyclic photophosphorylation scheme just discussed, high-energy electrons leaving photosystem II are harnessed to generate ATP and are passed on to photosystem I to drive the production of NADPH. This produces slightly more than 1 molecule of ATP for every pair of electrons that passes from H2O to NADP+ to generate a molecule of NADPH. But 1.5 molecules of ATP per NADPH are needed for carbon fixation (see Figure 14-39). To produce extra ATP, the chloroplasts in some species of plants can switch photosystem I into a cyclic mode so that it produces ATP instead of NADPH. In this process, called cyclic photophosphorylation, the high-energy electrons from photosystem I are transferred to the cytochrome b6-f complex rather than being passed on to NADP+. From the b6-f complex, the electrons are passed back to photosystem I at a low energy. The only net result, besides the conversion of some light energy to heat, is that H+ is pumped across the thylakoid membrane by the b6-f complex as electrons pass through it, thereby increasing the electrochemical proton gradient that drives the ATP synthase. (This is analogous to the right side of the diagram for purple nonsulfur bacteria in Figure 14-71, below.) To summarize, cyclic photophosphorylation involves only photosystem I, and it produces ATP without the formation of either NADPH or O2. The relative activities of cyclic and noncyclic electron flows can be regulated by the cell to determine how much light energy is converted into reducing power (NADPH) and how much into high-energy phosphate bonds (ATP).Photosystems I and II Have Related Structures, and Also Resemble Bacterial PhotosystemsThe mechanisms of fundamental cell processes such as DNA replication or respiration generally turn out to be the same in eucaryotic cells and in bacteria, even though the number of protein components involved is considerably greater in eucaryotes. Eucaryotes evolved from procaryotes, and the additional proteins presumably were selected for during evolution because they provided an extra degree of efficiency and/or regulation that was useful to the cell.Photosystems provide a clear example of this type of evolution. Photosystem II, for example, is formed from more than 25 different protein subunits, creating a large assembly in the thylakoid membrane with a mass of about 1 million daltons. The atomic structures of the eucaryotic photosystems are being revealed by a combination of electron and x-ray crystallography. The task is difficult because the complexes are large and embedded in the lipid bilayer. Nevertheless, as illustrated in Figure 14-48, the close relationship of photosystem I, photosystem II, and the photochemical reaction center of purple bacteria has been clearly demonstrated from these atomic-level analyses. Figure 14-48Three types of photosynthetic reaction centers compared. Pigments involved in light harvesting are colored green; those involved in the central photochemical events are colored red. (A) The photochemical reaction center of purple bacteria, whose detailed (more...)The Proton-Motive Force Is the Same in Mitochondria and ChloroplastsThe presence of the thylakoid space separates a chloroplast into three rather than the two internal compartments of a mitochondrion. The net effect of H+ translocation in the two organelles is, however, similar. As illustrated in Figure 14-49, in chloroplasts, H+ is pumped out of the stroma (pH 8) into the thylakoid space (pH ~5), creating a gradient of 3–3.5 pH units. This represents a proton-motive force of about 200 mV across the thylakoid membrane, and it drives ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase embedded in this membrane. The force is the same as that across the inner mitochondrial membrane, but nearly all of it is contributed by the pH gradient rather than by a membrane potential, unlike the case in mitochondria. Figure 14-49A comparison of the flow of H+ and the orientation of the ATP synthase in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Those compartments with similar pH values have been colored the same. The proton-motive force across the thylakoid membrane consists almost entirely (more...)Like the stroma, the mitochondrial matrix has a pH of about 8. This is created by pumping H+ out of the mitochondrion into the cytosol (pH ~7) rather than into an interior space in the organelle. Thus, the pH gradient is relatively small, and most of the proton-motive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane is instead caused by the resulting membrane potential (see Figure 14-13).For both mitochondria and chloroplasts, the catalytic site of the ATP synthase is at a pH of about 8 and is located in a large organelle compartment (matrix or stroma) that is packed full of soluble enzymes. Consequently, it is here that all of the organelle's ATP is made (see Figure 14-49).Carrier Proteins in the Chloroplast Inner Membrane Control Metabolite Exchange with the CytosolIf chloroplasts are isolated in a way that leaves their inner membrane intact, this membrane can be shown to have a selective permeability, reflecting the presence of specific carrier proteins. Most notably, much of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced by CO2 fixation in the chloroplast stroma is transported out of the chloroplast by an efficient antiport system that exchanges three-carbon sugar phosphates for an inward flux of inorganic phosphate.Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate normally provides the cytosol with an abundant source of carbohydrate, which is used by the cell as the starting point for many other biosyntheses—including the production of sucrose for export. But this is not all that this molecule provides. Once the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate reaches the cytosol, it is readily converted (by part of the glycolytic pathway) to 1,3-phosphoglycerate and then 3-phosphoglycerate (see p. 97), generating one molecule of ATP and one of NADH. (A similar two-step reaction, but working in reverse, forms glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the carbon-fixation cycle; see Figure 14-39.) As a result, the export of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate from the chloroplast provides not only the main source of fixed carbon to the rest of the cell, but also the reducing power and ATP needed for metabolism outside the chloroplast.Chloroplasts Also Perform Other Crucial BiosynthesesThe chloroplast performs many biosyntheses in addition to photosynthesis. All of the cell's fatty acids and a number of amino acids, for example, are made by enzymes in the chloroplast stroma. Similarly, the reducing power of light-activated electrons drives the reduction of nitrite (NO2-) to ammonia (NH3) in the chloroplast; this ammonia provides the plant with nitrogen for the synthesis of amino acids and nucleotides. The metabolic importance of the chloroplast for plants and algae therefore extends far beyond its role in photosynthesis.SummaryChloroplasts and photosynthetic bacteria obtain high-energy electrons by means of photosystems that capture the electrons that are excited when sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules. Photosystems are composed of an antenna complex that funnels energy to a photochemical reaction center, where a precisely ordered complex of proteins and pigments allows the energy of an excited electron in chlorophyll to be captured by electron carriers. The best-understood photochemical reaction center is that of purple photosynthetic bacteria, which contain only a single photosystem. In contrast, there are two distinct photosystems in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. The two photosystems are normally linked in series, and they transfer electrons from water to NADP+ to form NADPH, with the concomitant production of a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient. In these linked photosystems, molecular oxygen (O2) is generated as a by-product of removing four low-energy electrons from two specifically positioned water molecules.Compared with mitochondria, chloroplasts have an additional internal membrane (the thylakoid membrane) and a third internal space (the thylakoid space). All electron-transport processes occur in the thylakoid membrane: to make ATP, H+ is pumped into the thylakoid space, and a backflow of H+ through an ATP synthase then produces the ATP in the chloroplast stroma. This ATP is used in conjunction with the NADPH made by photosynthesis to drive a large number of biosynthetic reactions in the chloroplast stroma, including the all-important carbon-fixation cycle, which creates carbohydrate from CO2. Along with some other important chloroplast products, this carbohydrate is exported to the cell cytosol, where—as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate—it provides organic carbon, ATP, and reducing power to the rest of the cell.

  "Chloroplasts and PhotosynthesisAll animals and most microorganisms rely on the continual uptake of large amounts of organic compounds from their environment. These compounds are used to provide both the carbon skeletons for biosynthesis and the metabolic energy that drives cellular processes. It is believed that the first organisms on the primitive Earth had access to an abundance of the organic compounds produced by geochemical processes, but that most of these original compounds were used up billions of years ago. Since that time, the vast majority of the organic materials required by living cells have been produced by photosynthetic organisms, including many types of photosynthetic bacteria.The most advanced photosynthetic bacteria are the cyanobacteria, which have minimal nutrient requirements. They use electrons from water and the energy of sunlight when they convert atmospheric CO2 into organic compounds—a process called carbon fixation. In the course of splitting water [in the overall reaction nH2O + nCO2 (CH2O)n + nO2], they also liberate into the atmosphere the oxygen required for oxidative phosphorylation. As we see in this section, it is thought that the evolution of cyanobacteria from more primitive photosynthetic bacteria eventually made possible the development of abundant aerobic life forms.In plants and algae, which developed much later, photosynthesis occurs in a specialized intracellular organelle—the chloroplast. Chloroplasts perform photosynthesis during the daylight hours. The immediate products of photosynthesis, NADPH and ATP, are used by the photosynthetic cells to produce many organic molecules. In plants, the products include a low-molecular-weight sugar (usually sucrose) that is exported to meet the metabolic needs of the many nonphotosynthetic cells of the organism.Biochemical and genetic evidence strongly suggest that chloroplasts are descendants of oxygen-producing photosynthetic bacteria that were endocytosed and lived in symbiosis with primitive eucaryotic cells. Mitochondria are also generally believed to be descended from an endocytosed bacterium. The many differences between chloroplasts and mitochondria are thought to reflect their different bacterial ancestors, as well as their subsequent evolutionary divergence. Nevertheless, the fundamental mechanisms involved in light-driven ATP synthesis in chloroplasts are very similar to those that we have already discussed for respiration-driven ATP synthesis in mitochondria.The Chloroplast Is One Member of the Plastid Family of OrganellesChloroplasts are the most prominent members of the plastid family of organelles. Plastids are present in all living plant cells, each cell type having its own characteristic complement. All plastids share certain features. Most notably, all plastids in a particular plant species contain multiple copies of the same relatively small genome. In addition, each is enclosed by an envelope composed of two concentric membranes.As discussed in Chapter 12 (see Figure 12-3), all plastids develop from proplastids, small organelles in the immature cells of plant meristems (Figure 14-33A). Proplastids develop according to the requirements of each differentiated cell, and the type that is present is determined in large part by the nuclear genome. If a leaf is grown in darkness, its proplastids enlarge and develop into etioplasts, which have a semicrystalline array of internal membranes containing a yellow chlorophyll precursor instead of chlorophyll. When exposed to light, the etioplasts rapidly develop into chloroplasts by converting this precursor to chlorophyll and by synthesizing new membrane pigments, photosynthetic enzymes, and components of the electron-transport chain. Figure 14-33Plastid diversity. (A) A proplastid from a root tip cell of a bean plant. Note the double membrane; the inner membrane has also generated the relatively sparse internal membranes present. (B) Three amyloplasts (a form of leucoplast), or starch-storing (more...) Leucoplasts are plastids present in many epidermal and internal tissues that do not become green and photosynthetic. They are little more than enlarged proplastids. A common form of leucoplast is the amyloplast (Figure 14-33B), which accumulates the polysaccharide starch in storage tissues—a source of sugar for future use. In some plants, such as potatoes, the amyloplasts can grow to be as large as an average animal cell.It is important to realize that plastids are not just sites for photosynthesis and the deposition of storage materials. Plants have also used their plastids to compartmentalize their intermediary metabolism. Purine and pyrimidine synthesis, most amino acid synthesis, and all of the fatty acid synthesis of plants takes place in the plastids, whereas in animal cells these compounds are produced in the cytosol.Chloroplasts Resemble Mitochondria But Have an Extra CompartmentChloroplasts carry out their energy interconversions by chemiosmotic mechanisms in much the same way that mitochondria do. Although much larger (Figure 14-34A), they are organized on the same principles. They have a highly permeable outer membrane; a much less permeable inner membrane, in which membrane transport proteins are embedded; and a narrow intermembrane space in between. Together, these membranes form the chloroplast envelope (Figure 14-34B,C). The inner membrane surrounds a large space called the stroma, which is analogous to the mitochondrial matrix and contains many metabolic enzymes. Like the mitochondrion, the chloroplast has its own genome and genetic system. The stroma therefore also contains a special set of ribosomes, RNAs, and the chloroplast DNA. Figure 14-34Electron micrographs of chloroplasts. (A) In a wheat leaf cell, a thin rim of cytoplasm—containing chloroplasts, the nucleus, and mitochondria—surrounds a large vacuole. (B) A thin section of a single chloroplast, showing the chloroplast (more...)There is, however, an important difference between the organization of mitochondria and that of chloroplasts. The inner membrane of the chloroplast is not folded into cristae and does not contain electron-transport chains. Instead, the electron-transport chains, photosynthetic light-capturing systems, and ATP synthase are all contained in the thylakoid membrane, a third distinct membrane that forms a set of flattened disclike sacs, the thylakoids (Figure 14-35). The lumen of each thylakoid is thought to be connected with the lumen of other thylakoids, thereby defining a third internal compartment called the thylakoid space, which is separated by the thylakoid membrane from the stroma that surrounds it. Figure 14-35The chloroplast. This photosynthetic organelle contains three distinct membranes (the outer membrane, the inner membrane, and the thylakoid membrane) that define three separate internal compartments (the intermembrane space, the stroma, and the thylakoid (more...)The structural similarities and differences between mitochondria and chloroplasts are illustrated in Figure 14-36. The head of the chloroplast ATP synthase, where ATP is made, protrudes from the thylakoid membrane into the stroma, whereas it protrudes into the matrix from the inner mitochondrial membrane. Figure 14-36A mitochondrion and chloroplast compared. A chloroplast is generally much larger than a mitochondrion and contains, in addition to an outer and inner membrane, a thylakoid membrane enclosing a thylakoid space. Unlike the chloroplast inner membrane, the (more...)Chloroplasts Capture Energy from Sunlight and Use It to Fix CarbonThe many reactions that occur during photosynthesis in plants can be grouped into two broad categories: 1.In the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions (also called the “light reactions”), energy derived from sunlight energizes an electron in the green organic pigment chlorophyll, enabling the electron to move along an electron-transport chain in the thylakoid membrane in much the same way that an electron moves along the respiratory chain in mitochondria. The chlorophyll obtains its electrons from water (H2O), producing O2 as a by-product. During the electron-transport process, H+ is pumped across the thylakoid membrane, and the resulting electrochemical proton gradient drives the synthesis of ATP in the stroma. As the final step in this series of reactions, high-energy electrons are loaded (together with H+) onto NADP+, converting it to NADPH. All of these reactions are confined to the chloroplast.2.In the carbon-fixation reactions (also called the “dark reactions”), the ATP and the NADPH produced by the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions serve as the source of energy and reducing power, respectively, to drive the conversion of CO2 to carbohydrate. The carbon-fixation reactions, which begin in the chloroplast stroma and continue in the cytosol, produce sucrose and many other organic molecules in the leaves of the plant. The sucrose is exported to other tissues as a source of both organic molecules and energy for growth. Thus, the formation of ATP, NADPH, and O2 (which requires light energy directly) and the conversion of CO2 to carbohydrate (which requires light energy only indirectly) are separate processes (Figure 14-37), although elaborate feedback mechanisms interconnect the two. Several of the chloroplast enzymes required for carbon fixation, for example, are inactivated in the dark and reactivated by light-stimulated electron-transport processes. Figure 14-37The reactions of photosynthesis in a chloroplast. Water is oxidized and oxygen is released in the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions, while carbon dioxide is assimilated (fixed) to produce sugars and a variety of other organic molecules in the (more...)Carbon Fixation Is Catalyzed by Ribulose Bisphosphate CarboxylaseWe have seen earlier in this chapter how cells produce ATP by using the large amount of free energy released when carbohydrates are oxidized to CO2 and H2O. Clearly, therefore, the reverse reaction, in which CO2 and H2O combine to make carbohydrate, must be a very unfavorable one that can only occur if it is coupled to other, very favorable reactions that drive it.The central reaction of carbon fixation, in which an atom of inorganic carbon is converted to organic carbon, is illustrated in Figure 14-38: CO2 from the atmosphere combines with the five-carbon compound ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate plus water to yield two molecules of the three-carbon compound 3-phosphoglycerate. This “carbon-fixing” reaction, which was discovered in 1948, is catalyzed in the chloroplast stroma by a large enzyme called ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. Since each molecule of the complex works sluggishly (processing only about 3 molecules of substrate per second compared to 1000 molecules per second for a typical enzyme), many enzyme molecules are needed. Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase often constitutes more than 50% of the total chloroplast protein, and it is thought to be the most abundant protein on Earth. Figure 14-38The initial reaction in carbon fixation. This reaction, in which carbon dioxide is converted into organic carbon, is catalyzed in the chloroplast stroma by the abundant enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. The product is 3-phosphoglycerate, which (more...)Three Molecules of ATP and Two Molecules of NADPH Are Consumed for Each CO2 Molecule That Is FixedThe actual reaction in which CO2 is fixed is energetically favorable because of the reactivity of the energy-rich compound ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, to which each molecule of CO2 is added (see Figure 14-38). The elaborate metabolic pathway that produces ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate requires both NADPH and ATP; it was worked out in one of the first successful applications of radioisotopes as tracers in biochemistry. This carbon-fixation cycle (also called the Calvin cycle) is outlined in Figure 14-39. It starts when 3 molecules of CO2 are fixed by ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase to produce 6 molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (containing 6 × 3 = 18 carbon atoms in all: 3 from the CO2 and 15 from ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate). The 18 carbon atoms then undergo a cycle of reactions that regenerates the 3 molecules of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate used in the initial carbon-fixation step (containing 3 × 5 = 15 carbon atoms). This leaves 1 molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (3 carbon atoms) as the net gain. Figure 14-39The carbon-fixation cycle, which forms organic molecules from CO2 and H2O. The number of carbon atoms in each type of molecule is indicated in the white box. There are many intermediates between glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and ribulose 5-phosphate, but (more...)A total of 3 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of NADPH are consumed for each CO2 molecule converted into carbohydrate. The net equation is: Thus, both phosphate-bond energy (as ATP) and reducing power (as NADPH) are required for the formation of organic molecules from CO2 and H2O. We return to this important point later.The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced in chloroplasts by the carbon-fixation cycle is a three-carbon sugar that also serves as a central intermediate in glycolysis. Much of it is exported to the cytosol, where it can be converted into fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate by the reversal of several reactions in glycolysis (see Panel 2-8, pp. 124–125). The glucose 1-phosphate is then converted to the sugar nucleotide UDP-glucose, and this combines with the fructose 6-phosphate to form sucrose phosphate, the immediate precursor of the disaccharide sucrose. Sucrose is the major form in which sugar is transported between plant cells: just as glucose is transported in the blood of animals, sucrose is exported from the leaves via vascular bundles, providing the carbohydrate required by the rest of the plant.Most of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate that remains in the chloroplast is converted to starch in the stroma. Like glycogen in animal cells, starch is a large polymer of glucose that serves as a carbohydrate reserve (see Figure 14-33B). The production of starch is regulated so that it is produced and stored as large grains in the chloroplast stroma during periods of excess photosynthetic capacity. This occurs through reactions in the stroma that are the reverse of those in glycolysis: they convert glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to glucose 1-phosphate, which is then used to produce the sugar nucleotide ADP-glucose, the immediate precursor of starch. At night the starch is broken down to help support the metabolic needs of the plant. Starch provides an important part of the diet of all animals that eat plants.Carbon Fixation in Some Plants Is Compartmentalized to Facilitate Growth at Low CO2 ConcentrationsAlthough ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase preferentially adds CO2 to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, it can use O2 as a substrate in place of CO2, and if the concentration of CO2 is low, it will add O2 to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate instead (see Figure 14-38). This is the first step in a pathway called photorespiration, whose ultimate effect is to use up O2 and liberate CO2 without the production of useful energy stores. In many plants, about one-third of the CO2 fixed is lost again as CO2 because of photorespiration.Photorespiration can be a serious liability for plants in hot, dry conditions, which cause them to close their stomata (the gas exchange pores in their leaves) to avoid excessive water loss. This in turn causes the CO2 levels in the leaf to fall precipitously, thereby favoring photorespiration. A special adaptation, however, occurs in the leaves of many plants, such as corn and sugar cane that live in hot, dry environments. In these plants, the carbon-fixation cycle occurs only in the chloroplasts of specialized bundle-sheath cells, which contain all of the plant's ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. These cells are protected from the air and are surrounded by a specialized layer of mesophyll cells that use the energy harvested by their chloroplasts to “pump” CO2 into the bundle-sheath cells. This supplies the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase with a high concentration of CO2, thereby greatly reducing photorespiration.The CO2 pump is produced by a reaction cycle that begins in the cytosol of the mesophyll cells. A CO2-fixation step is catalyzed by an enzyme that binds carbon dioxide (as bicarbonate) and combines it with an activated three-carbon molecule to produce a four-carbon molecule. The four-carbon molecule diffuses into the bundle-sheath cells, where it is broken down to release the CO2 and generate a molecule with three carbons. The pumping cycle is completed when this three-carbon molecule is returned to the mesophyll cells and converted back to its original activated form. Because the CO2 is initially captured by converting it into a compound containing four carbons, the CO2-pumping plants are called C4 plants. All other plants are called C3 plants because they capture CO2 into the three-carbon compound 3-phosphoglycerate (Figure 14-40). Figure 14-40Comparative leaf anatomy in a C3 plant and a C4 plant. The cells with green cytosol in the leaf interior contain chloroplasts that perform the normal carbon-fixation cycle. In C4 plants, the mesophyll cells are specialized for CO2 pumping rather than (more...)As for any vectorial transport process, pumping CO2 into the bundle-sheath cells in C4 plants costs energy. In hot, dry environments, however, this cost can be much less than the energy lost by photorespiration in C3 plants, so C4 plants have a potential advantage. Moreover, because C4 plants can perform photosynthesis at a lower concentration of CO2 inside the leaf, they need to open their stomata less often and therefore can fix about twice as much net carbon as C3 plants per unit of water lost. Although the vast majority of plant species are C3 plants, C4 plants such as corn and sugar cane are much more effective at converting sunlight energy into biomass than C3 plants such as cereal grains. They are therefore of special importance in world agriculture.Photosynthesis Depends on the Photochemistry of Chlorophyll MoleculesHaving discussed the carbon-fixation reactions, we now return to the question of how the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions in the chloroplast generate the ATP and the NADPH needed to drive the production of carbohydrates from CO2 and H2O. The required energy is derived from sunlight absorbed by chlorophyll molecules (Figure 14-41). The process of energy conversion begins when a chlorophyll molecule is excited by a quantum of light (a photon) and an electron is moved from one molecular orbital to another of higher energy. As illustrated in Figure 14-42, such an excited molecule is unstable and tends to return to its original, unexcited state in one of three ways: Figure 14-41The structure of chlorophyll. A magnesium atom is held in a porphyrin ring, which is related to the porphyrin ring that binds iron in heme (see Figure 14-22). Electrons are delocalized over the bonds shown in blue. Figure 14-42Three ways for an excited chlorophyll molecule to return to its original, unexcited state. The light energy absorbed by an isolated chlorophyll molecule is completely released as light and heat by process 1. In photosynthesis, by contrast, chlorophylls (more...) 1.By converting the extra energy into heat (molecular motions) or to some combination of heat and light of a longer wavelength (fluorescence), which is what happens when light energy is absorbed by an isolated chlorophyll molecule in solution.2.By transferring the energy—but not the electron—directly to a neighboring chlorophyll molecule by a process called resonance energy transfer.3.By transferring the high-energy electron to another nearby molecule, an electron acceptor, and then returning to its original state by taking up a low-energy electron from some other molecule, an electron donor. The last two mechanisms are exploited in the process of photosynthesis.A Photosystem Consists of a Reaction Center Plus an Antenna ComplexMultiprotein complexes called photosystems catalyze the conversion of the light energy captured in excited chlorophyll molecules to useful forms. A photosystem consists of two closely linked components: an antenna complex, consisting of a large set of pigment molecules that capture light energy and feed it to the reaction center; and a photochemical reaction center, consisting of a complex of proteins and chlorophyll molecules that enable light energy to be converted into chemical energy (Figure 14-43). Figure 14-43The antenna complex and photochemical reaction center in a photosystem. The antenna complex is a collector of light energy in the form of excited electrons. The energy of the excited electrons is funneled, through a series of resonance energy transfers, (more...)The antenna complex is important for capturing light. In chloroplasts it consists of a number of distinct membrane protein complexes (known as light-harvesting complexes); together, these proteins bind several hundred chlorophyll molecules per reaction center, orienting them precisely in the thylakoid membrane. Depending on the plant, different amounts of accessory pigments called carotenoids, which protect the chlorophylls from oxidation and can help collect light of other wavelengths, are also located in each complex. When a chlorophyll molecule in the antenna complex is excited, the energy is rapidly transferred from one molecule to another by resonance energy transfer until it reaches a special pair of chlorophyll molecules in the photochemical reaction center. Each antenna complex thereby acts as a funnel, collecting light energy and directing it to a specific site where it can be used effectively (see Figure 14-43).The photochemical reaction center is a transmembrane protein-pigment complex that lies at the heart of photosynthesis. It is thought to have evolved more than 3 billion years ago in primitive photosynthetic bacteria. The special pair of chlorophyll molecules in the reaction center acts as an irreversible trap for excitation quanta because its excited electron is immediately passed to a chain of electron acceptors that are precisely positioned as neighbors in the same protein complex (Figure 14-44). By moving the high-energy electron rapidly away from the chlorophylls, the photochemical reaction center transfers it to an environment where it is much more stable. The electron is thereby suitably positioned for subsequent reactions, which require more time to complete. Figure 14-44The arrangement of the electron carriers in a bacterial photochemical reaction center, as determined by x-ray crystallography. The pigment molecules shown are held in the interior of a transmembrane protein and are surrounded by the lipid bilayer of the (more...)In a Reaction Center, Light Energy Captured by Chlorophyll Creates a Strong Electron Donor from a Weak OneThe electron transfers involved in the photochemical reactions just outlined have been analyzed extensively by rapid spectroscopic methods. An enormous amount of detailed information is available for the photosystem of purple bacteria, which is somewhat simpler than the evolutionarily related photosystems in chloroplasts. The reaction center in this photosystem is a large protein-pigment complex that can be solubilized with detergent and purified in active form. In 1985, its complete three-dimensional structure was determined by x-ray crystallography (see Figure 10-38). This structure, combined with kinetic data, provides the best picture we have of the initial electron-transfer reactions that underlie photosynthesis.The sequence of electron transfers that take place in the reaction center of purple bacteria is shown in Figure 14-45. As outlined previously for the general case (see Figure 14-43), light causes a net electron transfer from a weak electron donor (a molecule with a strong affinity for electrons) to a molecule that is a strong electron donor in its reduced form. The excitation energy in chlorophyll that would normally be released as fluorescence or heat is thereby used instead to create a strong electron donor (a molecule carrying a high-energy electron) where none had been before. In the purple bacterium, the weak electron donor used to fill the electron-deficient hole created by a light-induced charge separation is a cytochrome (see orange box in Figure 14-45); the strong electron donor produced is a quinone. In the chloroplasts of higher plants, a quinone is similarly produced. However, as we discuss next, water serves as the initial weak electron donor, which is why oxygen gas is released by photosynthesis in plants. Figure 14-45The electron transfers that occur in the photochemical reaction center of a purple bacterium. A similar set of reactions occurs in the evolutionarily related photosystem II in plants. At the top left is an orientating diagram showing the molecules that (more...)Noncyclic Photophosphorylation Produces Both NADPH and ATPPhotosynthesis in plants and cyanobacteria produces both ATP and NADPH directly by a two-step process called noncyclic photophosphorylation. Because two photosystems—called photosystems I and II—are used in series to energize an electron, the electron can be transferred all the way from water to NADPH. As the high-energy electrons pass through the coupled photosystems to generate NADPH, some of their energy is siphoned off for ATP synthesis.The first of the two photosystems—paradoxically called photosystem II for historical reasons—has the unique ability to withdraw electrons from water. The oxygens of two water molecules bind to a cluster of manganese atoms in a poorly understood water-splitting enzyme. This enzyme enables electrons to be removed one at a time from the water, as required to fill the electron-deficient holes created by light in chlorophyll molecules in the reaction center. As soon as four electrons have been removed from the two water molecules (requiring four quanta of light), O2 is released. Photosystem II thus catalyzes the reaction 2H2O + 4 photons → 4H+ + 4e - + O2. As we discussed for the electron-transport chain in mitochondria, which uses O2 and produces water, the mechanism ensures that no partly oxidized water molecules are released as dangerous, highly reactive oxygen radicals. Essentially all the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere has been produced in this way.The core of the reaction center in photosystem II is homologous to the bacterial reaction center just described, and it likewise produces strong electron donors in the form of reduced quinone molecules dissolved in the lipid bilayer of the membrane. The quinones pass their electrons to a H+ pump called the cytochrome b6-f complex, which resembles the cytochrome b-c1 complex in the respiratory chain of mitochondria. The cytochrome b6-f complex pumps H+ into the thylakoid space across the thylakoid membrane (or out of the cytosol across the plasma membrane in cyanobacteria), and the resulting electrochemical gradient drives the synthesis of ATP by an ATP synthase (Figure 14-46). Figure 14-46Electron flow during photosynthesis in the thylakoid membrane. The mobile electron carriers in the chain are plastoquinone (which closely resembles the ubiquinone of mitochondria), plastocyanin (a small copper-containing protein), and ferredoxin (a small (more...)The final electron acceptor in this electron-transport chain is the second photosystem, photosystem I, which accepts an electron into the electron-deficient hole created by light in the chlorophyll molecule in its reaction center. Each electron that enters photosystem I is finally boosted to a very high-energy level that allows it to be passed to the iron-sulfur center in ferredoxin and then to NADP+ to generate NADPH (Figure 14-47). Figure 14-47Changes in redox potential during photosynthesis. The redox potential for each molecule is indicated by its position along the vertical axis. In photosystem II, the excited reaction center chlorophyll has a redox potential high enough to withdraw electrons (more...)The scheme for photosynthesis just discussed is known as the Z scheme. By means of its two electron-energizing steps, one catalyzed by each photosystem, an electron is passed from water, which normally holds on to its electrons very tightly (redox potential = +820 mV), to NADPH, which normally holds on to its electrons loosely (redox potential = -320 mV). There is not enough energy in a single quantum of visible light to energize an electron all the way from the bottom of photosystem II to the top of photosystem I, which is presumably the energy change required to pass an electron efficiently from water to NADP+. The use of two separate photosystems in series means that the energy from two quanta of light is available for this purpose. In addition, there is enough energy left over to enable the electron-transport chain that links the two photosystems to pump H+ across the thylakoid membrane (or the plasma membrane of cyanobacteria), so that the ATP synthase can harness some of the light-derived energy for ATP production.Chloroplasts Can Make ATP by Cyclic Photophosphorylation Without Making NADPHIn the noncyclic photophosphorylation scheme just discussed, high-energy electrons leaving photosystem II are harnessed to generate ATP and are passed on to photosystem I to drive the production of NADPH. This produces slightly more than 1 molecule of ATP for every pair of electrons that passes from H2O to NADP+ to generate a molecule of NADPH. But 1.5 molecules of ATP per NADPH are needed for carbon fixation (see Figure 14-39). To produce extra ATP, the chloroplasts in some species of plants can switch photosystem I into a cyclic mode so that it produces ATP instead of NADPH. In this process, called cyclic photophosphorylation, the high-energy electrons from photosystem I are transferred to the cytochrome b6-f complex rather than being passed on to NADP+. From the b6-f complex, the electrons are passed back to photosystem I at a low energy. The only net result, besides the conversion of some light energy to heat, is that H+ is pumped across the thylakoid membrane by the b6-f complex as electrons pass through it, thereby increasing the electrochemical proton gradient that drives the ATP synthase. (This is analogous to the right side of the diagram for purple nonsulfur bacteria in Figure 14-71, below.) To summarize, cyclic photophosphorylation involves only photosystem I, and it produces ATP without the formation of either NADPH or O2. The relative activities of cyclic and noncyclic electron flows can be regulated by the cell to determine how much light energy is converted into reducing power (NADPH) and how much into high-energy phosphate bonds (ATP).Photosystems I and II Have Related Structures, and Also Resemble Bacterial PhotosystemsThe mechanisms of fundamental cell processes such as DNA replication or respiration generally turn out to be the same in eucaryotic cells and in bacteria, even though the number of protein components involved is considerably greater in eucaryotes. Eucaryotes evolved from procaryotes, and the additional proteins presumably were selected for during evolution because they provided an extra degree of efficiency and/or regulation that was useful to the cell.Photosystems provide a clear example of this type of evolution. Photosystem II, for example, is formed from more than 25 different protein subunits, creating a large assembly in the thylakoid membrane with a mass of about 1 million daltons. The atomic structures of the eucaryotic photosystems are being revealed by a combination of electron and x-ray crystallography. The task is difficult because the complexes are large and embedded in the lipid bilayer. Nevertheless, as illustrated in Figure 14-48, the close relationship of photosystem I, photosystem II, and the photochemical reaction center of purple bacteria has been clearly demonstrated from these atomic-level analyses. Figure 14-48Three types of photosynthetic reaction centers compared. Pigments involved in light harvesting are colored green; those involved in the central photochemical events are colored red. (A) The photochemical reaction center of purple bacteria, whose detailed (more...)The Proton-Motive Force Is the Same in Mitochondria and ChloroplastsThe presence of the thylakoid space separates a chloroplast into three rather than the two internal compartments of a mitochondrion. The net effect of H+ translocation in the two organelles is, however, similar. As illustrated in Figure 14-49, in chloroplasts, H+ is pumped out of the stroma (pH 8) into the thylakoid space (pH ~5), creating a gradient of 3–3.5 pH units. This represents a proton-motive force of about 200 mV across the thylakoid membrane, and it drives ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase embedded in this membrane. The force is the same as that across the inner mitochondrial membrane, but nearly all of it is contributed by the pH gradient rather than by a membrane potential, unlike the case in mitochondria. Figure 14-49A comparison of the flow of H+ and the orientation of the ATP synthase in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Those compartments with similar pH values have been colored the same. The proton-motive force across the thylakoid membrane consists almost entirely (more...)Like the stroma, the mitochondrial matrix has a pH of about 8. This is created by pumping H+ out of the mitochondrion into the cytosol (pH ~7) rather than into an interior space in the organelle. Thus, the pH gradient is relatively small, and most of the proton-motive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane is instead caused by the resulting membrane potential (see Figure 14-13).For both mitochondria and chloroplasts, the catalytic site of the ATP synthase is at a pH of about 8 and is located in a large organelle compartment (matrix or stroma) that is packed full of soluble enzymes. Consequently, it is here that all of the organelle's ATP is made (see Figure 14-49).Carrier Proteins in the Chloroplast Inner Membrane Control Metabolite Exchange with the CytosolIf chloroplasts are isolated in a way that leaves their inner membrane intact, this membrane can be shown to have a selective permeability, reflecting the presence of specific carrier proteins. Most notably, much of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced by CO2 fixation in the chloroplast stroma is transported out of the chloroplast by an efficient antiport system that exchanges three-carbon sugar phosphates for an inward flux of inorganic phosphate.Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate normally provides the cytosol with an abundant source of carbohydrate, which is used by the cell as the starting point for many other biosyntheses—including the production of sucrose for export. But this is not all that this molecule provides. Once the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate reaches the cytosol, it is readily converted (by part of the glycolytic pathway) to 1,3-phosphoglycerate and then 3-phosphoglycerate (see p. 97), generating one molecule of ATP and one of NADH. (A similar two-step reaction, but working in reverse, forms glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the carbon-fixation cycle; see Figure 14-39.) As a result, the export of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate from the chloroplast provides not only the main source of fixed carbon to the rest of the cell, but also the reducing power and ATP needed for metabolism outside the chloroplast.Chloroplasts Also Perform Other Crucial BiosynthesesThe chloroplast performs many biosyntheses in addition to photosynthesis. All of the cell's fatty acids and a number of amino acids, for example, are made by enzymes in the chloroplast stroma. Similarly, the reducing power of light-activated electrons drives the reduction of nitrite (NO2-) to ammonia (NH3) in the chloroplast; this ammonia provides the plant with nitrogen for the synthesis of amino acids and nucleotides. The metabolic importance of the chloroplast for plants and algae therefore extends far beyond its role in photosynthesis.SummaryChloroplasts and photosynthetic bacteria obtain high-energy electrons by means of photosystems that capture the electrons that are excited when sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules. Photosystems are composed of an antenna complex that funnels energy to a photochemical reaction center, where a precisely ordered complex of proteins and pigments allows the energy of an excited electron in chlorophyll to be captured by electron carriers. The best-understood photochemical reaction center is that of purple photosynthetic bacteria, which contain only a single photosystem. In contrast, there are two distinct photosystems in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. The two photosystems are normally linked in series, and they transfer electrons from water to NADP+ to form NADPH, with the concomitant production of a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient. In these linked photosystems, molecular oxygen (O2) is generated as a by-product of removing four low-energy electrons from two specifically positioned water molecules.Compared with mitochondria, chloroplasts have an additional internal membrane (the thylakoid membrane) and a third internal space (the thylakoid space). All electron-transport processes occur in the thylakoid membrane: to make ATP, H+ is pumped into the thylakoid space, and a backflow of H+ through an ATP synthase then produces the ATP in the chloroplast stroma. This ATP is used in conjunction with the NADPH made by photosynthesis to drive a large number of biosynthetic reactions in the chloroplast stroma, including the all-important carbon-fixation cycle, which creates carbohydrate from CO2. Along with some other important chloroplast products, this carbohydrate is exported to the cell cytosol, where—as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate—it provides organic carbon, ATP, and reducing power to the rest of the cell.",
  "All animals and most microorganisms rely on the continual uptake of large amounts of organic compounds from their environment. These compounds are used to provide both the carbon skeletons for biosynthesis and the metabolic energy that drives cellular processes. It is believed that the first organisms on the primitive Earth had access to an abundance of the organic compounds produced by geochemical processes, but that most of these original compounds were used up billions of years ago. Since that time, the vast majority of the organic materials required by living cells have been produced by photosynthetic organisms, including many types of photosynthetic bacteria.The most advanced photosynthetic bacteria are the cyanobacteria, which have minimal nutrient requirements. They use electrons from water and the energy of sunlight when they convert atmospheric CO2 into organic compounds—a process called carbon fixation. In the course of splitting water [in the overall reaction nH2O + nCO2 (CH2O)n + nO2], they also liberate into the atmosphere the oxygen required for oxidative phosphorylation. As we see in this section, it is thought that the evolution of cyanobacteria from more primitive photosynthetic bacteria eventually made possible the development of abundant aerobic life forms.In plants and algae, which developed much later, photosynthesis occurs in a specialized intracellular organelle—the chloroplast. Chloroplasts perform photosynthesis during the daylight hours. The immediate products of photosynthesis, NADPH and ATP, are used by the photosynthetic cells to produce many organic molecules. In plants, the products include a low-molecular-weight sugar (usually sucrose) that is exported to meet the metabolic needs of the many nonphotosynthetic cells of the organism.Biochemical and genetic evidence strongly suggest that chloroplasts are descendants of oxygen-producing photosynthetic bacteria that were endocytosed and lived in symbiosis with primitive eucaryotic cells. Mitochondria are also generally believed to be descended from an endocytosed bacterium. The many differences between chloroplasts and mitochondria are thought to reflect their different bacterial ancestors, as well as their subsequent evolutionary divergence. Nevertheless, the fundamental mechanisms involved in light-driven ATP synthesis in chloroplasts are very similar to those that we have already discussed for respiration-driven ATP synthesis in mitochondria.The Chloroplast Is One Member of the Plastid Family of OrganellesChloroplasts are the most prominent members of the plastid family of organelles. Plastids are present in all living plant cells, each cell type having its own characteristic complement. All plastids share certain features. Most notably, all plastids in a particular plant species contain multiple copies of the same relatively small genome. In addition, each is enclosed by an envelope composed of two concentric membranes.As discussed in Chapter 12 (see Figure 12-3), all plastids develop from proplastids, small organelles in the immature cells of plant meristems (Figure 14-33A). Proplastids develop according to the requirements of each differentiated cell, and the type that is present is determined in large part by the nuclear genome. If a leaf is grown in darkness, its proplastids enlarge and develop into etioplasts, which have a semicrystalline array of internal membranes containing a yellow chlorophyll precursor instead of chlorophyll. When exposed to light, the etioplasts rapidly develop into chloroplasts by converting this precursor to chlorophyll and by synthesizing new membrane pigments, photosynthetic enzymes, and components of the electron-transport chain. Figure 14-33Plastid diversity. (A) A proplastid from a root tip cell of a bean plant. Note the double membrane; the inner membrane has also generated the relatively sparse internal membranes present. (B) Three amyloplasts (a form of leucoplast), or starch-storing (more...) Leucoplasts are plastids present in many epidermal and internal tissues that do not become green and photosynthetic. They are little more than enlarged proplastids. A common form of leucoplast is the amyloplast (Figure 14-33B), which accumulates the polysaccharide starch in storage tissues—a source of sugar for future use. In some plants, such as potatoes, the amyloplasts can grow to be as large as an average animal cell.It is important to realize that plastids are not just sites for photosynthesis and the deposition of storage materials. Plants have also used their plastids to compartmentalize their intermediary metabolism. Purine and pyrimidine synthesis, most amino acid synthesis, and all of the fatty acid synthesis of plants takes place in the plastids, whereas in animal cells these compounds are produced in the cytosol.Chloroplasts Resemble Mitochondria But Have an Extra CompartmentChloroplasts carry out their energy interconversions by chemiosmotic mechanisms in much the same way that mitochondria do. Although much larger (Figure 14-34A), they are organized on the same principles. They have a highly permeable outer membrane; a much less permeable inner membrane, in which membrane transport proteins are embedded; and a narrow intermembrane space in between. Together, these membranes form the chloroplast envelope (Figure 14-34B,C). The inner membrane surrounds a large space called the stroma, which is analogous to the mitochondrial matrix and contains many metabolic enzymes. Like the mitochondrion, the chloroplast has its own genome and genetic system. The stroma therefore also contains a special set of ribosomes, RNAs, and the chloroplast DNA. Figure 14-34Electron micrographs of chloroplasts. (A) In a wheat leaf cell, a thin rim of cytoplasm—containing chloroplasts, the nucleus, and mitochondria—surrounds a large vacuole. (B) A thin section of a single chloroplast, showing the chloroplast (more...)There is, however, an important difference between the organization of mitochondria and that of chloroplasts. The inner membrane of the chloroplast is not folded into cristae and does not contain electron-transport chains. Instead, the electron-transport chains, photosynthetic light-capturing systems, and ATP synthase are all contained in the thylakoid membrane, a third distinct membrane that forms a set of flattened disclike sacs, the thylakoids (Figure 14-35). The lumen of each thylakoid is thought to be connected with the lumen of other thylakoids, thereby defining a third internal compartment called the thylakoid space, which is separated by the thylakoid membrane from the stroma that surrounds it. Figure 14-35The chloroplast. This photosynthetic organelle contains three distinct membranes (the outer membrane, the inner membrane, and the thylakoid membrane) that define three separate internal compartments (the intermembrane space, the stroma, and the thylakoid (more...)The structural similarities and differences between mitochondria and chloroplasts are illustrated in Figure 14-36. The head of the chloroplast ATP synthase, where ATP is made, protrudes from the thylakoid membrane into the stroma, whereas it protrudes into the matrix from the inner mitochondrial membrane. Figure 14-36A mitochondrion and chloroplast compared. A chloroplast is generally much larger than a mitochondrion and contains, in addition to an outer and inner membrane, a thylakoid membrane enclosing a thylakoid space. Unlike the chloroplast inner membrane, the (more...)Chloroplasts Capture Energy from Sunlight and Use It to Fix CarbonThe many reactions that occur during photosynthesis in plants can be grouped into two broad categories: 1.In the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions (also called the “light reactions”), energy derived from sunlight energizes an electron in the green organic pigment chlorophyll, enabling the electron to move along an electron-transport chain in the thylakoid membrane in much the same way that an electron moves along the respiratory chain in mitochondria. The chlorophyll obtains its electrons from water (H2O), producing O2 as a by-product. During the electron-transport process, H+ is pumped across the thylakoid membrane, and the resulting electrochemical proton gradient drives the synthesis of ATP in the stroma. As the final step in this series of reactions, high-energy electrons are loaded (together with H+) onto NADP+, converting it to NADPH. All of these reactions are confined to the chloroplast.2.In the carbon-fixation reactions (also called the “dark reactions”), the ATP and the NADPH produced by the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions serve as the source of energy and reducing power, respectively, to drive the conversion of CO2 to carbohydrate. The carbon-fixation reactions, which begin in the chloroplast stroma and continue in the cytosol, produce sucrose and many other organic molecules in the leaves of the plant. The sucrose is exported to other tissues as a source of both organic molecules and energy for growth. Thus, the formation of ATP, NADPH, and O2 (which requires light energy directly) and the conversion of CO2 to carbohydrate (which requires light energy only indirectly) are separate processes (Figure 14-37), although elaborate feedback mechanisms interconnect the two. Several of the chloroplast enzymes required for carbon fixation, for example, are inactivated in the dark and reactivated by light-stimulated electron-transport processes. Figure 14-37The reactions of photosynthesis in a chloroplast. Water is oxidized and oxygen is released in the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions, while carbon dioxide is assimilated (fixed) to produce sugars and a variety of other organic molecules in the (more...)Carbon Fixation Is Catalyzed by Ribulose Bisphosphate CarboxylaseWe have seen earlier in this chapter how cells produce ATP by using the large amount of free energy released when carbohydrates are oxidized to CO2 and H2O. Clearly, therefore, the reverse reaction, in which CO2 and H2O combine to make carbohydrate, must be a very unfavorable one that can only occur if it is coupled to other, very favorable reactions that drive it.The central reaction of carbon fixation, in which an atom of inorganic carbon is converted to organic carbon, is illustrated in Figure 14-38: CO2 from the atmosphere combines with the five-carbon compound ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate plus water to yield two molecules of the three-carbon compound 3-phosphoglycerate. This “carbon-fixing” reaction, which was discovered in 1948, is catalyzed in the chloroplast stroma by a large enzyme called ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. Since each molecule of the complex works sluggishly (processing only about 3 molecules of substrate per second compared to 1000 molecules per second for a typical enzyme), many enzyme molecules are needed. Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase often constitutes more than 50% of the total chloroplast protein, and it is thought to be the most abundant protein on Earth. Figure 14-38The initial reaction in carbon fixation. This reaction, in which carbon dioxide is converted into organic carbon, is catalyzed in the chloroplast stroma by the abundant enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. The product is 3-phosphoglycerate, which (more...)Three Molecules of ATP and Two Molecules of NADPH Are Consumed for Each CO2 Molecule That Is FixedThe actual reaction in which CO2 is fixed is energetically favorable because of the reactivity of the energy-rich compound ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, to which each molecule of CO2 is added (see Figure 14-38). The elaborate metabolic pathway that produces ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate requires both NADPH and ATP; it was worked out in one of the first successful applications of radioisotopes as tracers in biochemistry. This carbon-fixation cycle (also called the Calvin cycle) is outlined in Figure 14-39. It starts when 3 molecules of CO2 are fixed by ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase to produce 6 molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (containing 6 × 3 = 18 carbon atoms in all: 3 from the CO2 and 15 from ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate). The 18 carbon atoms then undergo a cycle of reactions that regenerates the 3 molecules of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate used in the initial carbon-fixation step (containing 3 × 5 = 15 carbon atoms). This leaves 1 molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (3 carbon atoms) as the net gain. Figure 14-39The carbon-fixation cycle, which forms organic molecules from CO2 and H2O. The number of carbon atoms in each type of molecule is indicated in the white box. There are many intermediates between glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and ribulose 5-phosphate, but (more...)A total of 3 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of NADPH are consumed for each CO2 molecule converted into carbohydrate. The net equation is: Thus, both phosphate-bond energy (as ATP) and reducing power (as NADPH) are required for the formation of organic molecules from CO2 and H2O. We return to this important point later.The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced in chloroplasts by the carbon-fixation cycle is a three-carbon sugar that also serves as a central intermediate in glycolysis. Much of it is exported to the cytosol, where it can be converted into fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate by the reversal of several reactions in glycolysis (see Panel 2-8, pp. 124–125). The glucose 1-phosphate is then converted to the sugar nucleotide UDP-glucose, and this combines with the fructose 6-phosphate to form sucrose phosphate, the immediate precursor of the disaccharide sucrose. Sucrose is the major form in which sugar is transported between plant cells: just as glucose is transported in the blood of animals, sucrose is exported from the leaves via vascular bundles, providing the carbohydrate required by the rest of the plant.Most of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate that remains in the chloroplast is converted to starch in the stroma. Like glycogen in animal cells, starch is a large polymer of glucose that serves as a carbohydrate reserve (see Figure 14-33B). The production of starch is regulated so that it is produced and stored as large grains in the chloroplast stroma during periods of excess photosynthetic capacity. This occurs through reactions in the stroma that are the reverse of those in glycolysis: they convert glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to glucose 1-phosphate, which is then used to produce the sugar nucleotide ADP-glucose, the immediate precursor of starch. At night the starch is broken down to help support the metabolic needs of the plant. Starch provides an important part of the diet of all animals that eat plants.Carbon Fixation in Some Plants Is Compartmentalized to Facilitate Growth at Low CO2 ConcentrationsAlthough ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase preferentially adds CO2 to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, it can use O2 as a substrate in place of CO2, and if the concentration of CO2 is low, it will add O2 to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate instead (see Figure 14-38). This is the first step in a pathway called photorespiration, whose ultimate effect is to use up O2 and liberate CO2 without the production of useful energy stores. In many plants, about one-third of the CO2 fixed is lost again as CO2 because of photorespiration.Photorespiration can be a serious liability for plants in hot, dry conditions, which cause them to close their stomata (the gas exchange pores in their leaves) to avoid excessive water loss. This in turn causes the CO2 levels in the leaf to fall precipitously, thereby favoring photorespiration. A special adaptation, however, occurs in the leaves of many plants, such as corn and sugar cane that live in hot, dry environments. In these plants, the carbon-fixation cycle occurs only in the chloroplasts of specialized bundle-sheath cells, which contain all of the plant's ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. These cells are protected from the air and are surrounded by a specialized layer of mesophyll cells that use the energy harvested by their chloroplasts to “pump” CO2 into the bundle-sheath cells. This supplies the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase with a high concentration of CO2, thereby greatly reducing photorespiration.The CO2 pump is produced by a reaction cycle that begins in the cytosol of the mesophyll cells. A CO2-fixation step is catalyzed by an enzyme that binds carbon dioxide (as bicarbonate) and combines it with an activated three-carbon molecule to produce a four-carbon molecule. The four-carbon molecule diffuses into the bundle-sheath cells, where it is broken down to release the CO2 and generate a molecule with three carbons. The pumping cycle is completed when this three-carbon molecule is returned to the mesophyll cells and converted back to its original activated form. Because the CO2 is initially captured by converting it into a compound containing four carbons, the CO2-pumping plants are called C4 plants. All other plants are called C3 plants because they capture CO2 into the three-carbon compound 3-phosphoglycerate (Figure 14-40). Figure 14-40Comparative leaf anatomy in a C3 plant and a C4 plant. The cells with green cytosol in the leaf interior contain chloroplasts that perform the normal carbon-fixation cycle. In C4 plants, the mesophyll cells are specialized for CO2 pumping rather than (more...)As for any vectorial transport process, pumping CO2 into the bundle-sheath cells in C4 plants costs energy. In hot, dry environments, however, this cost can be much less than the energy lost by photorespiration in C3 plants, so C4 plants have a potential advantage. Moreover, because C4 plants can perform photosynthesis at a lower concentration of CO2 inside the leaf, they need to open their stomata less often and therefore can fix about twice as much net carbon as C3 plants per unit of water lost. Although the vast majority of plant species are C3 plants, C4 plants such as corn and sugar cane are much more effective at converting sunlight energy into biomass than C3 plants such as cereal grains. They are therefore of special importance in world agriculture.Photosynthesis Depends on the Photochemistry of Chlorophyll MoleculesHaving discussed the carbon-fixation reactions, we now return to the question of how the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions in the chloroplast generate the ATP and the NADPH needed to drive the production of carbohydrates from CO2 and H2O. The required energy is derived from sunlight absorbed by chlorophyll molecules (Figure 14-41). The process of energy conversion begins when a chlorophyll molecule is excited by a quantum of light (a photon) and an electron is moved from one molecular orbital to another of higher energy. As illustrated in Figure 14-42, such an excited molecule is unstable and tends to return to its original, unexcited state in one of three ways: Figure 14-41The structure of chlorophyll. A magnesium atom is held in a porphyrin ring, which is related to the porphyrin ring that binds iron in heme (see Figure 14-22). Electrons are delocalized over the bonds shown in blue. Figure 14-42Three ways for an excited chlorophyll molecule to return to its original, unexcited state. The light energy absorbed by an isolated chlorophyll molecule is completely released as light and heat by process 1. In photosynthesis, by contrast, chlorophylls (more...) 1.By converting the extra energy into heat (molecular motions) or to some combination of heat and light of a longer wavelength (fluorescence), which is what happens when light energy is absorbed by an isolated chlorophyll molecule in solution.2.By transferring the energy—but not the electron—directly to a neighboring chlorophyll molecule by a process called resonance energy transfer.3.By transferring the high-energy electron to another nearby molecule, an electron acceptor, and then returning to its original state by taking up a low-energy electron from some other molecule, an electron donor. The last two mechanisms are exploited in the process of photosynthesis.A Photosystem Consists of a Reaction Center Plus an Antenna ComplexMultiprotein complexes called photosystems catalyze the conversion of the light energy captured in excited chlorophyll molecules to useful forms. A photosystem consists of two closely linked components: an antenna complex, consisting of a large set of pigment molecules that capture light energy and feed it to the reaction center; and a photochemical reaction center, consisting of a complex of proteins and chlorophyll molecules that enable light energy to be converted into chemical energy (Figure 14-43). Figure 14-43The antenna complex and photochemical reaction center in a photosystem. The antenna complex is a collector of light energy in the form of excited electrons. The energy of the excited electrons is funneled, through a series of resonance energy transfers, (more...)The antenna complex is important for capturing light. In chloroplasts it consists of a number of distinct membrane protein complexes (known as light-harvesting complexes); together, these proteins bind several hundred chlorophyll molecules per reaction center, orienting them precisely in the thylakoid membrane. Depending on the plant, different amounts of accessory pigments called carotenoids, which protect the chlorophylls from oxidation and can help collect light of other wavelengths, are also located in each complex. When a chlorophyll molecule in the antenna complex is excited, the energy is rapidly transferred from one molecule to another by resonance energy transfer until it reaches a special pair of chlorophyll molecules in the photochemical reaction center. Each antenna complex thereby acts as a funnel, collecting light energy and directing it to a specific site where it can be used effectively (see Figure 14-43).The photochemical reaction center is a transmembrane protein-pigment complex that lies at the heart of photosynthesis. It is thought to have evolved more than 3 billion years ago in primitive photosynthetic bacteria. The special pair of chlorophyll molecules in the reaction center acts as an irreversible trap for excitation quanta because its excited electron is immediately passed to a chain of electron acceptors that are precisely positioned as neighbors in the same protein complex (Figure 14-44). By moving the high-energy electron rapidly away from the chlorophylls, the photochemical reaction center transfers it to an environment where it is much more stable. The electron is thereby suitably positioned for subsequent reactions, which require more time to complete. Figure 14-44The arrangement of the electron carriers in a bacterial photochemical reaction center, as determined by x-ray crystallography. The pigment molecules shown are held in the interior of a transmembrane protein and are surrounded by the lipid bilayer of the (more...)In a Reaction Center, Light Energy Captured by Chlorophyll Creates a Strong Electron Donor from a Weak OneThe electron transfers involved in the photochemical reactions just outlined have been analyzed extensively by rapid spectroscopic methods. An enormous amount of detailed information is available for the photosystem of purple bacteria, which is somewhat simpler than the evolutionarily related photosystems in chloroplasts. The reaction center in this photosystem is a large protein-pigment complex that can be solubilized with detergent and purified in active form. In 1985, its complete three-dimensional structure was determined by x-ray crystallography (see Figure 10-38). This structure, combined with kinetic data, provides the best picture we have of the initial electron-transfer reactions that underlie photosynthesis.The sequence of electron transfers that take place in the reaction center of purple bacteria is shown in Figure 14-45. As outlined previously for the general case (see Figure 14-43), light causes a net electron transfer from a weak electron donor (a molecule with a strong affinity for electrons) to a molecule that is a strong electron donor in its reduced form. The excitation energy in chlorophyll that would normally be released as fluorescence or heat is thereby used instead to create a strong electron donor (a molecule carrying a high-energy electron) where none had been before. In the purple bacterium, the weak electron donor used to fill the electron-deficient hole created by a light-induced charge separation is a cytochrome (see orange box in Figure 14-45); the strong electron donor produced is a quinone. In the chloroplasts of higher plants, a quinone is similarly produced. However, as we discuss next, water serves as the initial weak electron donor, which is why oxygen gas is released by photosynthesis in plants. Figure 14-45The electron transfers that occur in the photochemical reaction center of a purple bacterium. A similar set of reactions occurs in the evolutionarily related photosystem II in plants. At the top left is an orientating diagram showing the molecules that (more...)Noncyclic Photophosphorylation Produces Both NADPH and ATPPhotosynthesis in plants and cyanobacteria produces both ATP and NADPH directly by a two-step process called noncyclic photophosphorylation. Because two photosystems—called photosystems I and II—are used in series to energize an electron, the electron can be transferred all the way from water to NADPH. As the high-energy electrons pass through the coupled photosystems to generate NADPH, some of their energy is siphoned off for ATP synthesis.The first of the two photosystems—paradoxically called photosystem II for historical reasons—has the unique ability to withdraw electrons from water. The oxygens of two water molecules bind to a cluster of manganese atoms in a poorly understood water-splitting enzyme. This enzyme enables electrons to be removed one at a time from the water, as required to fill the electron-deficient holes created by light in chlorophyll molecules in the reaction center. As soon as four electrons have been removed from the two water molecules (requiring four quanta of light), O2 is released. Photosystem II thus catalyzes the reaction 2H2O + 4 photons → 4H+ + 4e - + O2. As we discussed for the electron-transport chain in mitochondria, which uses O2 and produces water, the mechanism ensures that no partly oxidized water molecules are released as dangerous, highly reactive oxygen radicals. Essentially all the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere has been produced in this way.The core of the reaction center in photosystem II is homologous to the bacterial reaction center just described, and it likewise produces strong electron donors in the form of reduced quinone molecules dissolved in the lipid bilayer of the membrane. The quinones pass their electrons to a H+ pump called the cytochrome b6-f complex, which resembles the cytochrome b-c1 complex in the respiratory chain of mitochondria. The cytochrome b6-f complex pumps H+ into the thylakoid space across the thylakoid membrane (or out of the cytosol across the plasma membrane in cyanobacteria), and the resulting electrochemical gradient drives the synthesis of ATP by an ATP synthase (Figure 14-46). Figure 14-46Electron flow during photosynthesis in the thylakoid membrane. The mobile electron carriers in the chain are plastoquinone (which closely resembles the ubiquinone of mitochondria), plastocyanin (a small copper-containing protein), and ferredoxin (a small (more...)The final electron acceptor in this electron-transport chain is the second photosystem, photosystem I, which accepts an electron into the electron-deficient hole created by light in the chlorophyll molecule in its reaction center. Each electron that enters photosystem I is finally boosted to a very high-energy level that allows it to be passed to the iron-sulfur center in ferredoxin and then to NADP+ to generate NADPH (Figure 14-47). Figure 14-47Changes in redox potential during photosynthesis. The redox potential for each molecule is indicated by its position along the vertical axis. In photosystem II, the excited reaction center chlorophyll has a redox potential high enough to withdraw electrons (more...)The scheme for photosynthesis just discussed is known as the Z scheme. By means of its two electron-energizing steps, one catalyzed by each photosystem, an electron is passed from water, which normally holds on to its electrons very tightly (redox potential = +820 mV), to NADPH, which normally holds on to its electrons loosely (redox potential = -320 mV). There is not enough energy in a single quantum of visible light to energize an electron all the way from the bottom of photosystem II to the top of photosystem I, which is presumably the energy change required to pass an electron efficiently from water to NADP+. The use of two separate photosystems in series means that the energy from two quanta of light is available for this purpose. In addition, there is enough energy left over to enable the electron-transport chain that links the two photosystems to pump H+ across the thylakoid membrane (or the plasma membrane of cyanobacteria), so that the ATP synthase can harness some of the light-derived energy for ATP production.Chloroplasts Can Make ATP by Cyclic Photophosphorylation Without Making NADPHIn the noncyclic photophosphorylation scheme just discussed, high-energy electrons leaving photosystem II are harnessed to generate ATP and are passed on to photosystem I to drive the production of NADPH. This produces slightly more than 1 molecule of ATP for every pair of electrons that passes from H2O to NADP+ to generate a molecule of NADPH. But 1.5 molecules of ATP per NADPH are needed for carbon fixation (see Figure 14-39). To produce extra ATP, the chloroplasts in some species of plants can switch photosystem I into a cyclic mode so that it produces ATP instead of NADPH. In this process, called cyclic photophosphorylation, the high-energy electrons from photosystem I are transferred to the cytochrome b6-f complex rather than being passed on to NADP+. From the b6-f complex, the electrons are passed back to photosystem I at a low energy. The only net result, besides the conversion of some light energy to heat, is that H+ is pumped across the thylakoid membrane by the b6-f complex as electrons pass through it, thereby increasing the electrochemical proton gradient that drives the ATP synthase. (This is analogous to the right side of the diagram for purple nonsulfur bacteria in Figure 14-71, below.) To summarize, cyclic photophosphorylation involves only photosystem I, and it produces ATP without the formation of either NADPH or O2. The relative activities of cyclic and noncyclic electron flows can be regulated by the cell to determine how much light energy is converted into reducing power (NADPH) and how much into high-energy phosphate bonds (ATP).Photosystems I and II Have Related Structures, and Also Resemble Bacterial PhotosystemsThe mechanisms of fundamental cell processes such as DNA replication or respiration generally turn out to be the same in eucaryotic cells and in bacteria, even though the number of protein components involved is considerably greater in eucaryotes. Eucaryotes evolved from procaryotes, and the additional proteins presumably were selected for during evolution because they provided an extra degree of efficiency and/or regulation that was useful to the cell.Photosystems provide a clear example of this type of evolution. Photosystem II, for example, is formed from more than 25 different protein subunits, creating a large assembly in the thylakoid membrane with a mass of about 1 million daltons. The atomic structures of the eucaryotic photosystems are being revealed by a combination of electron and x-ray crystallography. The task is difficult because the complexes are large and embedded in the lipid bilayer. Nevertheless, as illustrated in Figure 14-48, the close relationship of photosystem I, photosystem II, and the photochemical reaction center of purple bacteria has been clearly demonstrated from these atomic-level analyses. Figure 14-48Three types of photosynthetic reaction centers compared. Pigments involved in light harvesting are colored green; those involved in the central photochemical events are colored red. (A) The photochemical reaction center of purple bacteria, whose detailed (more...)The Proton-Motive Force Is the Same in Mitochondria and ChloroplastsThe presence of the thylakoid space separates a chloroplast into three rather than the two internal compartments of a mitochondrion. The net effect of H+ translocation in the two organelles is, however, similar. As illustrated in Figure 14-49, in chloroplasts, H+ is pumped out of the stroma (pH 8) into the thylakoid space (pH ~5), creating a gradient of 3–3.5 pH units. This represents a proton-motive force of about 200 mV across the thylakoid membrane, and it drives ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase embedded in this membrane. The force is the same as that across the inner mitochondrial membrane, but nearly all of it is contributed by the pH gradient rather than by a membrane potential, unlike the case in mitochondria. Figure 14-49A comparison of the flow of H+ and the orientation of the ATP synthase in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Those compartments with similar pH values have been colored the same. The proton-motive force across the thylakoid membrane consists almost entirely (more...)Like the stroma, the mitochondrial matrix has a pH of about 8. This is created by pumping H+ out of the mitochondrion into the cytosol (pH ~7) rather than into an interior space in the organelle. Thus, the pH gradient is relatively small, and most of the proton-motive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane is instead caused by the resulting membrane potential (see Figure 14-13).For both mitochondria and chloroplasts, the catalytic site of the ATP synthase is at a pH of about 8 and is located in a large organelle compartment (matrix or stroma) that is packed full of soluble enzymes. Consequently, it is here that all of the organelle's ATP is made (see Figure 14-49).Carrier Proteins in the Chloroplast Inner Membrane Control Metabolite Exchange with the CytosolIf chloroplasts are isolated in a way that leaves their inner membrane intact, this membrane can be shown to have a selective permeability, reflecting the presence of specific carrier proteins. Most notably, much of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced by CO2 fixation in the chloroplast stroma is transported out of the chloroplast by an efficient antiport system that exchanges three-carbon sugar phosphates for an inward flux of inorganic phosphate.Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate normally provides the cytosol with an abundant source of carbohydrate, which is used by the cell as the starting point for many other biosyntheses—including the production of sucrose for export. But this is not all that this molecule provides. Once the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate reaches the cytosol, it is readily converted (by part of the glycolytic pathway) to 1,3-phosphoglycerate and then 3-phosphoglycerate (see p. 97), generating one molecule of ATP and one of NADH. (A similar two-step reaction, but working in reverse, forms glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the carbon-fixation cycle; see Figure 14-39.) As a result, the export of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate from the chloroplast provides not only the main source of fixed carbon to the rest of the cell, but also the reducing power and ATP needed for metabolism outside the chloroplast.Chloroplasts Also Perform Other Crucial BiosynthesesThe chloroplast performs many biosyntheses in addition to photosynthesis. All of the cell's fatty acids and a number of amino acids, for example, are made by enzymes in the chloroplast stroma. Similarly, the reducing power of light-activated electrons drives the reduction of nitrite (NO2-) to ammonia (NH3) in the chloroplast; this ammonia provides the plant with nitrogen for the synthesis of amino acids and nucleotides. The metabolic importance of the chloroplast for plants and algae therefore extends far beyond its role in photosynthesis.SummaryChloroplasts and photosynthetic bacteria obtain high-energy electrons by means of photosystems that capture the electrons that are excited when sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules. Photosystems are composed of an antenna complex that funnels energy to a photochemical reaction center, where a precisely ordered complex of proteins and pigments allows the energy of an excited electron in chlorophyll to be captured by electron carriers. The best-understood photochemical reaction center is that of purple photosynthetic bacteria, which contain only a single photosystem. In contrast, there are two distinct photosystems in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. The two photosystems are normally linked in series, and they transfer electrons from water to NADP+ to form NADPH, with the concomitant production of a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient. In these linked photosystems, molecular oxygen (O2) is generated as a by-product of removing four low-energy electrons from two specifically positioned water molecules.Compared with mitochondria, chloroplasts have an additional internal membrane (the thylakoid membrane) and a third internal space (the thylakoid space). All electron-transport processes occur in the thylakoid membrane: to make ATP, H+ is pumped into the thylakoid space, and a backflow of H+ through an ATP synthase then produces the ATP in the chloroplast stroma. This ATP is used in conjunction with the NADPH made by photosynthesis to drive a large number of biosynthetic reactions in the chloroplast stroma, including the all-important carbon-fixation cycle, which creates carbohydrate from CO2. Along with some other important chloroplast products, this carbohydrate is exported to the cell cytosol, where—as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate—it provides organic carbon, ATP, and reducing power to the rest of the cell."

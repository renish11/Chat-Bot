  "query": "who is indira gandhi",
  "answer": "Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi[b] (née Nehru; 19 November 1917 – 31 October 1984)[2] was an Indian politician and stateswoman who served as the prime minister of India from 1966 to 1977 and again from 1980 until her assassination in 1984. She was India's first and, to date, only female prime minister, and a central figure in Indian politics as the leader of the Indian National Congress (INC). She was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, and the mother of Rajiv Gandhi, who succeeded her as prime minister. Gandhi's cumulative tenure of 15 years and 350 days makes her the second-longest-serving Indian prime minister after her father. Henry Kissinger described her as an \"Iron Lady\", a nickname that became associated with her tough personality."

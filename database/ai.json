    "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a set of technologies that enable computers to perform a variety of advanced functions, including the ability to see, understand and translate spoken and written language, analyze data, make recommendations, and more.",
    "AI is the backbone of innovation in modern computing, unlocking value for individuals and businesses. For example, optical character recognition (OCR) uses AI to extract text and data from images and documents, turns unstructured content into business-ready structured data, and unlocks valuable insights.",
    "AI is a broad field that encompasses many different disciplines, including computer science, data analytics and statistics, hardware and software engineering, linguistics, neuroscience, and even philosophy and psychology.",
    "On an operational level for business use, AI is a set of technologies that are based primarily on machine learning and deep learning, used for data analytics, predictions and forecasting, object categorization, natural language processing, recommendations, intelligent data retrieval, and more.",
    "While the specifics vary across different AI techniques, the core principle revolves around data. AI systems learn and improve through exposure to vast amounts of data, identifying patterns and relationships that humans may miss.",
    "This learning process often involves algorithms, which are sets of rules or instructions that guide the AI's analysis and decision-making. In machine learning, a popular subset of AI, algorithms are trained on labeled or unlabeled data to make predictions or categorize information.",
    "Deep learning, a further specialization, utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers to process information, mimicking the structure and function of the human brain. Through continuous learning and adaptation, AI systems become increasingly adept at performing specific tasks, from recognizing images to translating languages and beyond.",
    "Want to learn how to get started with AI? Take the free beginner's introduction to generative AI.",
    "For instance, four stages of AI development are commonly recognized.",
    "A more useful way of broadly categorizing types of artificial intelligence is by what the machine can do. All of what we currently call artificial intelligence is considered artificial “narrow” intelligence, in that it can perform only narrow sets of actions based on its programming and training. For instance, an AI algorithm that is used for object classification won’t be able to perform natural language processing. Google Search is a form of narrow AI, as is predictive analytics, or virtual assistants.",
    "When businesses talk about AI, they often talk about “training data.” But what does that mean? Remember that limited-memory artificial intelligence is AI that improves over time by being trained with new data. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to train data to obtain results.",
    "A common type of training model in AI is an artificial neural network, a model loosely based on the human brain.",
    "AI can automate workflows and processes or work independently and autonomously from a human team. For example, AI can help automate aspects of cybersecurity by continuously monitoring and analyzing network traffic. Similarly, a smart factory may have dozens of different kinds of AI in use, such as robots using computer vision to navigate the factory floor or to inspect products for defects, create digital twins, or use real-time analytics to measure efficiency and output.",
    "AI can eliminate manual errors in data processing, analytics, assembly in manufacturing, and other tasks through automation and algorithms that follow the same processes every single time.",
    "AI can be used to perform repetitive tasks, freeing human capital to work on higher impact problems. AI can be used to automate processes, like verifying documents, transcribing phone calls, or answering simple customer questions like “what time do you close?” Robots are often used to perform “dull, dirty, or dangerous” tasks in the place of a human.",
    "AI can process more information more quickly than a human, finding patterns and discovering relationships in data that a human may miss.",
    "AI is not limited by time of day, the need for breaks, or other human encumbrances. When running in the cloud, AI and machine learning can be “always on,” continuously working on its assigned tasks.",
    "The ability to analyze vast amounts of data quickly can lead to accelerated breakthroughs in research and development. For instance, AI has been used in predictive modeling of potential new pharmaceutical treatments, or to quantify the human genome.",
    "Google offers a number of sophisticated artificial intelligence products, solutions, and applications on a trusted cloud platform that enables businesses to easily build and implement AI algorithms and models.",
    "By using products like Vertex AI, CCAI, DocAI, or AI APIs, organizations can make sense of all the data they’re producing, collecting, or otherwise analyzing, no matter what format it’s in, to make actionable business decisions.",
    "Save your seat: On March 11th, be the first to see insights from the 2025 Google AI infrastructure research report.",
    "Artificial intelligence (AI) is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity and autonomy.",
    "Applications and devices equipped with AI can see and identify objects. They can understand and respond to human language. They can learn from new information and experience. They can make detailed recommendations to users and experts. They can act independently, replacing the need for human intelligence or intervention (a classic example being a self-driving car).",
    "But in 2024, most AI researchers, practitioners and most AI-related headlines are focused on breakthroughs in generative AI (gen AI), a technology that can create original text, images, video and other content. To fully understand generative AI, it’s important to first understand the technologies on which generative AI tools are built: machine learning (ML) and deep learning.",
    "Stay up to date on the most important—and intriguing—industry trends on AI, automation, data and beyond with the Think newsletter. See the IBM Privacy Statement.",
    "A simple way to think about AI is as a series of nested or derivative concepts that have emerged over more than 70 years:",
    "Directly underneath AI, we have machine learning, which involves creating models by training an algorithm to make predictions or decisions based on data. It encompasses a broad range of techniques that enable computers to learn from and make inferences based on data without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.",
    "Because deep learning doesn’t require human intervention, it enables machine learning at a tremendous scale. It is well suited to natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and other tasks that involve the fast, accurate identification complex patterns and relationships in large amounts of data. Some form of deep learning powers most of the artificial intelligence (AI) applications in our lives today.",
    "Generative AI, sometimes called \"gen AI\", refers to deep learning models that can create complex original content such as long-form text, high-quality images, realistic video or audio and more in response to a user’s prompt or request.",
    "Join our world-class panel of engineers, researchers, product leaders and more as they cut through the AI noise to bring you the latest in AI news and insights.",
    "In general, generative AI operates in three phases:",
    "Generative AI begins with a \"foundation model\"; a deep learning model that serves as the basis for multiple different types of generative AI applications.",
    "This training process is compute-intensive, time-consuming and expensive. It requires thousands of clustered graphics processing units (GPUs) and weeks of processing, all of which typically costs millions of dollars. Open source foundation model projects, such as Meta's Llama-2, enable gen AI developers to avoid this step and its costs.",
    "Developers and users regularly assess the outputs of their generative AI apps, and further tune the model even as often as once a week for greater accuracy or relevance. In contrast, the foundation model itself is updated much less frequently, perhaps every year or 18 months.",
    "Another option for improving a gen AI app's performance is retrieval augmented generation (RAG), a technique for extending the foundation model to use relevant sources outside of the training data to refine the parameters for greater accuracy or relevance.",
    "An AI agent is an autonomous AI program, it can perform tasks and accomplish goals on behalf of a user or another system without human intervention, by designing its own workflow and using available tools (other applications or services).",
    "Agentic AI is a system of multiple AI agents, the efforts of which are coordinated, or orchestrated, to accomplish a more complex task or a greater goal than any single agent in the system could accomplish.",
    "Unlike chatbots and other AI models which operate within predefined constraints and require human intervention, AI agents and agentic AI exhibit autonomy, goal-driven behavior and adaptability to changing circumstances. The terms “agent” and “agentic” refer to these models’ agency, or their capacity to act independently and purposefully.",
    "One way to think of agents is as a natural next step after generative AI. Gen AI models focus on creating content based on learned patterns; agents use that content to interact with each other and other tools to make decisions, solve problems and complete tasks. For example, a gen AI app might be able to tell you the best time to climb Mt. Everest given your work schedule, but an agent can tell you this, and then use an online travel service to book you the best flight and reserve a room in the most convenient hotel in Nepal.",
    "AI offers numerous benefits across various industries and applications. Some of the most commonly cited benefits include:",
    "AI can automate routine, repetitive and often tedious tasks including digital tasks such as data collection, entering and preprocessing, and physical tasks such as warehouse stock-picking and manufacturing processes. This automation frees to work on higher value, more creative work.",
    "Whether used for decision support or for fully automated decision-making, AI enables faster, more accurate predictions and reliable, data-driven decisions. Combined with automation, AI enables businesses to act on opportunities and respond to crises as they emerge, in real time and without human intervention.",
    "AI can reduce human errors in various ways, from guiding people through the proper steps of a process, to flagging potential errors before they occur, and fully automating processes without human intervention. This is especially important in industries such as healthcare where, for example, AI-guided surgical robotics enable consistent precision.",
    "AI is always on, available around the clock, and delivers consistent performance every time. Tools such as AI chatbots or virtual assistants can lighten staffing demands for customer service or support. In other applications such as materials processing or production lines, AI can help maintain consistent work quality and output levels when used to complete repetitive or tedious tasks.",
    "By automating dangerous work such as animal control, handling explosives, performing tasks in deep ocean water, high altitudes or in outer space, AI can eliminate the need to put human workers at risk of injury or worse. While they have yet to be perfected, self-driving cars and other vehicles offer the potential to reduce the risk of injury to passengers.",
    "The real-world applications of AI are many. Here is just a small sampling of use cases across various industries to illustrate its potential:",
    "Companies can implement AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants to handle customer inquiries, support tickets and more. These tools use natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI capabilities to understand and respond to customer questions about order status, product details and return policies.",
    "Retailers, banks and other customer-facing companies can use AI to create personalized customer experiences and marketing campaigns that delight customers, improve sales and prevent churn. Based on data from customer purchase history and behaviors, deep learning algorithms can recommend products and services customers are likely to want, and even generate personalized copy and special offers for individual customers in real time.",
    "Generative AI code generation tools and automation tools can streamline repetitive coding tasks associated with application development, and accelerate the migration and modernization (reformatting and replatorming) of legacy applications at scale. These tools can speed up tasks, help ensure code consistency and reduce errors.",
    "Organizations are scrambling to take advantage of the latest AI technologies and capitalize on AI's many benefits. This rapid adoption is necessary, but adopting and maintaining AI workflows comes with challenges and risks.",
    "AI systems rely on data sets that might be vulnerable to data poisoning, data tampering, data bias or cyberattacks that can lead to data breaches. Organizations can mitigate these risks by protecting data integrity and implementing security and availability throughout the entire AI lifecycle, from development to training and deployment and postdeployment.",
    "Threat actors can target AI models for theft, reverse engineering or unauthorized manipulation. Attackers might compromise a model’s integrity by tampering with its architecture, weights or parameters; the core components that determine a model’s behavior, accuracy and performance.",
    "If organizations don’t prioritize safety and ethics when developing and deploying AI systems, they risk committing privacy violations and producing biased outcomes. For example, biased training data used for hiring decisions might reinforce gender or racial stereotypes and create AI models that favor certain demographic groups over others.",
    "AI ethics is a multidisciplinary field that studies how to optimize AI's beneficial impact while reducing risks and adverse outcomes. Principles of AI ethics are applied through a system of AI governance consisted of guardrails that help ensure that AI tools and systems remain safe and ethical.",
    "AI governance encompasses oversight mechanisms that address risks. An ethical approach to AI governance requires the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders, including developers, users, policymakers and ethicists, helping to ensure that AI-related systems are developed and used to align with society's values.",
    "Here are common values associated with AI ethics and responsible AI:",
    "As AI becomes more advanced, humans are challenged to comprehend and retrace how the algorithm came to a result. Explainable AI is a set of processes and methods that enables human users to interpret, comprehend and trust the results and output created by algorithms.",
    "Robust AI effectively handles exceptional conditions, such as abnormalities in input or malicious attacks, without causing unintentional harm. It is also built to withstand intentional and unintentional interference by protecting against exposed vulnerabilities.",
    "Organizations should implement clear responsibilities and governance structures for the development, deployment and outcomes of AI systems. In addition, users should be able to see how an AI service works, evaluate its functionality, and comprehend its strengths and limitations. Increased transparency provides information for AI consumers to better understand how the AI model or service was created.",
    "Many regulatory frameworks, including GDPR, mandate that organizations abide by certain privacy principles when processing personal information. It is crucial to be able to protect AI models that might contain personal information, control what data goes into the model in the first place, and to build adaptable systems that can adjust to changes in regulation and attitudes around AI ethics.",
    "In order to contextualize the use of AI at various levels of complexity and sophistication, researchers have defined several types of AI that refer to its level of sophistication:",
    "Weak AI: Also known as “narrow AI,” defines AI systems designed to perform a specific task or a set of tasks. Examples might include “smart” voice assistant apps, such as Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, a social media chatbot or the autonomous vehicles promised by Tesla.",
    "Strong AI: Also known as “artificial general intelligence” (AGI) or “general AI,” possess the ability to understand, learn and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level equal to or surpassing human intelligence. This level of AI is currently theoretical and no known AI systems approach this level of sophistication. Researchers argue that if AGI is even possible, it requires major increases in computing power. Despite recent advances in AI development, self-aware AI systems of science fiction remain firmly in that realm.",
    "The idea of \"a machine that thinks\" dates back to ancient Greece. But since the advent of electronic computing (and relative to some of the topics discussed in this article) important events and milestones in the evolution of AI include the following:",
    "From there, he offers a test, now famously known as the \"Turing Test,\" where a human interrogator would try to distinguish between a computer and human text response. While this test has undergone much scrutiny since it was published, it remains an important part of the history of AI, and an ongoing concept within philosophy as it uses ideas around linguistics.",
    "1956 John McCarthy coins the term \"artificial intelligence\" at the first-ever AI conference at Dartmouth College. (McCarthy went on to invent the Lisp language.) Later that year, Allen Newell, J.C. Shaw and Herbert Simon create the Logic Theorist, the first-ever running AI computer program.",
    "1980 Neural networks, which use a backpropagation algorithm to train itself, became widely used in AI applications.",
    "1995 Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig publish Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, which becomes one of the leading textbooks in the study of AI. In it, they delve into four potential goals or definitions of AI, which differentiates computer systems based on rationality and thinking versus acting.",
    "2004 John McCarthy writes a paper, What Is Artificial Intelligence?, and proposes an often-cited definition of AI. By this time, the era of big data and cloud computing is underway, enabling organizations to manage ever-larger data estates, which will one day be used to train AI models.",
    "2022 A rise in large language models or LLMs, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, creates an enormous change in performance of AI and its potential to drive enterprise value. With these new generative AI practices, deep-learning models can be pretrained on large amounts of data.",
    "2024 The latest AI trends point to a continuing AI renaissance. Multimodal models that can take multiple types of data as input are providing richer, more robust experiences. These models bring together computer vision image recognition and NLP speech recognition capabilities. Smaller models are also making strides in an age of diminishing returns with massive models with large parameter counts.",

    "Semi-supervised learning is a branch of machine learning that combines supervised and unsupervised learning by using both labeled and unlabeled data to train artificial intelligence (AI) models for classification and regression tasks.",
    "Training AI models for prediction tasks like classification or regression typically requires labeled data: annotated data points that provide necessary context and demonstrate the correct predictions (output) for each sample input. During training, a loss function measures the difference (loss) between the model’s predictions for a given input and the “ground truth” provided by that input’s label. Models learn from these labeled examples by using techniques like gradient descent that update model weights to minimize loss. Because this machine learning process actively involves humans, it is called “supervised” learning.",
    "Properly labeling data becomes increasingly labor-intensive for complex AI tasks. For example, to train an image classification model to differentiate between cars and motorcycles, hundreds (if not thousands) of training images must be labeled “car” or “motorcycle”; for a more detailed computer vision task, like object detection, humans must not only annotate the object(s) each image contains, but where each object is located; for even more detailed tasks, like image segmentation, data labels must annotate specific pixel-by-pixel boundaries of different image segments for each image.",

    "Given the breadth and depth of AI development, no roundup of AI trends can hope to be exhaustive. This piece is no exception. We’ve narrowed things down to a list of 10: 5 developments that have driven the first half of the year, and 5 more that we expect to play a major role in the months to come.",
    "Trends in AI are driven not only by advancements in AI models and algorithms themselves, but by the ever-expanding array of use cases to which generative AI (gen AI) capabilities are being applied. As models grow more capable, versatile and efficient, so too do the AI applications, AI tools and other AI-powered workflows they enable. A true understanding of how today’s AI ecosystem is evolving therefore requires a contextual understanding of the causes and effects of machine learning breakthroughs.",
    "This article primarily explores ongoing trends whose real-world impact might be realized on a horizon of months: in other words, trends with tangible impact mostly on or in the year 2025. There are, of course, other AI initiatives that are more evergreen and familiar. For example, though there has been recent movement on fully self-driving vehicles in isolated pockets—robotaxi pilots have been launched in a handful of U.S. cities, with additional trials abroad in Oslo, Geneva and 16 Chinese cities—they’re likely still years away from ubiquity.",
    "Many other important macro trends in AI—such as the advent of AI agents, or AI's disruption of search behaviors and SEO—are broad, multi-faceted and already well covered elsewhere, and so were left out in favor of more focused developments that haven't received such widespread media attention.",
    "Discover expertly curated insights and news on AI, cloud and more in the weekly Think Newsletter.",
    "Progress doesn't necessarily require a constant influx of brand new ideas. Many of the most important AI trends in the first half of 2025 reflect changes in how the industry is applying existing ideas—some pragmatic and productive, others less so.",
    "Today’s models are not only significantly better than the models of yesteryear, but also vastly cheaper to run. Consider this chart from SemiAnalysis: in under 2 years, the per-token pricing to achieve equivalent results on the MMLU benchmark decreased dozens of times over. This is hardly news to anyone who has been monitoring the performance metrics of each successive generation of model releases. But viewed in the aggregate, this constantly accelerating pace of improvement illustrates the case for generative AI hype better than viewing the already-impressive capabilities of present-day models.",
    "This exponential expansion of model economy, more than anything, is what empowers the emerging era of AI agents. Large language models (LLMs) are becoming more practical even faster than they’re becoming more capable, which enables the deployment of complex multi-agent systems in which a cadre of models can plan, execute and coordinate on complex tasks autonomously—without skyrocketing inference costs.",
    "The release of OpenAI’s o1 introduced a new avenue for increasing model performance. Its head-turning improvement over prior state-of-the-art performance on highly technical math and coding benchmarks initiated an arms race in so-called “reasoning models.” Their enhanced performance on tasks requiring logical decision-making figures to play an important role in the development of agentic AI. But as is often the case with AI technology, the initial frenzy over raw performance has more recently given way to a search for the most practical implementation.",
    "AI development has always heavily relied on leveraging open source knowledge repositories, such as Wikipedia and GitHub. Their importance will only increase moving forward, especially after high-profile revelations that major AI developers have been training models on pirated book torrents—which will presumably discourage continued use of those alternate sources. For the organizations running invaluable open source resources, the situation is already causing serious strain.",
    "While a bevy of lawsuits have brought awareness to the harms of data harvesting—whether legal, illegal or ambiguous—on intellectual property, less attention has been paid to how AI systems’ hunger for data harms knowledge repositories. As the Wikimedia Foundation articulated in an April announcement on bot traffic, “[their] content is free, [their] infrastructure is not.” Wikimedia in particular has experienced a potentially unsustainable onslaught of web traffic from scraping bots collecting data to train generative AI models. Since January 2024, bandwidth used for downloading Wikimedia’s multimedia content has grown by 50%.",
    "In response, many projects are actively pursuing defensive measures. One open source project, Anubis, forces bots to solve computation puzzles before gaining access. Another, Nepenthes, sends AI crawlers down an “infinite maze.” Cloudflare, a prominent web infrastructure provider, recently launched a feature they call “AI Labyrinth,” which uses a similar (albeit less aggressive) approach. Wikimedia is marshaling a new initiative, WE5: Responsible Use of Infrastructure, aimed at a structural solution.",
    "The ability of commercial AI development and open knowledge repositories to collaboratively develop a mutually suitable protocol will have tremendous impact on not only the future of AI, but on the future of the Internet itself.",
    "Though the concept behind mixture of experts (MoE) models dates back to 1991, it didn’t enter mainstream natural language processing (NLP) or generative AI until Mistral AI’s release of its Mixtral model in late 2023.6 Though the model and its architecture received a great deal of attention—and OpenAI’s GPT-4 was rumored (albeit never confirmed) to be an MoE upon release—it largely didn’t motivate the industry to stray from its focus on conventional “dense” LLMs.",
    "The future is always hard to predict. The breakneck pace of improvement in prior generations of AI models had many expecting the generation of models to be released in 2025 to make meaningful steps toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). While the latest models from OpenAI, Meta and the other most-funded players in the AI space are no doubt impressive, they’re certainly short of revolutionary.",
    "On the practical implementation side, progress has been uneven. Many business leaders who were bullish on their organization’s AI adoption outlook at the end of 2023 spent 2024 realizing that their organization’s IT infrastructure wasn’t ready to scale AI yet.",
    "A common refrain amongst AI analysts is that AI will take over mundane, repetitive tasks and free up time for humans to focus on big picture, creative thinking. But thus far, data on AI adoption doesn’t necessarily reflect that in reality. A study conducted by the IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) found that the opposite was true, at least in the retail industry’s content supply chain: 88% of retailers reported use of gen AI for “creative ideation/concepting” and 74% reported using it for “content creation and editing.” Meanwhile, most mundane work is still human territory: only 23% of retailers are using gen AI for generating content variations by channel and only 10% are using it for generating content variations by geo.",
    "All in all, it’s not that organizations aren’t actively pursuing AI adoption—a new IBV report shows that they definitely are, particularly with regard to AI agents—but rather that it’s not happening at a straightforward, linear pace. The transition from experimentation to formal operationalization is rarely smooth.",
    "Join our world-class panel of engineers, researchers, product leaders and more as they cut through the AI noise to bring you the latest in AI news and insights.",
    "By the back half of 2025 (and on through the beginning of next year), pieces will be in place for meaningful disruption of some aspects of the status quo in place since the earliest days of the ongoing generative AI era.",
    "On a fundamental level, there’s no perfect benchmark (or set of benchmarks) for AI performance. Any benchmark is subject to Goodhart’s Law: “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Nevertheless, it benefits model development—and the business leaders tasked with choosing specific AI solutions and models—to have standardized, transparently-administered measures of performance to facilitate apples-to-apples comparisons.",
    "First introduced in 2017, transformer models are largely responsible for the era of generative AI, and they continue to be the backbone of everything from image generation to time series models to LLMs. Though transformers are certainly not going anywhere anytime soon, they’re about to have some company.",
    "When it comes to transformers or mamba, the future of AI is not probably an “either/or” situation: in fact, research suggests that a hybrid of the two is better than either on their own. Several mamba or hybrid mamba/transformer models have been released in the past year. Most have been academic research-only models, with notable exceptions including Mistral AI’s Codestral Mamba and AI2I’s hybrid Jamba series. More recently, the upcoming IBM Granite 4.0 series will be using a hybrid of transformer and Mamba-2 architectures.",
    "Most importantly, the reduced hardware requirements of Mamba and hybrid models will significantly reduce hardware costs, which in turn will help continue to democratize AI access.",
    "The advent of multimodal AI models marked the expansion of LLMs beyond text, but the next frontier of AI development aims to bring those multimodal abilities into the physical world.",
    "This emerging field largely falls under the heading of “Embodied AI.” Venture capital firms are increasingly pouring funding into startups pursuing advanced, generative AI-driven humanoid robotics, such as Skild AI, Physical Intelligence, and 1X Technologies.",
    "Many (but not all) leading AI experts, including Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist and one of the three “godfathers of deep learning,\"7 believe that world models, not LLMs, are the true path to AGI. In public comments, LeCun often alludes to Moravec’s paradox, the counterintuitive notion that in AI, complex reasoning skills are straightforward but simple sensorimotor and perception tasks that a child can do easily are not.8",
    "Along these lines, some interesting research endeavors are aiming to teach AI to understand concepts, rather than just words, by embodying that AI in a robot and teaching it the way we teach things to infants.",
    "The long-term promise of AI agents is that they’ll use AI to carry out complex, context-specific tasks autonomously with little to no human intervention. To be able to personalize its decision-making to the specific, contextually intricate needs of a given workplace or situation—the way a competent employee or assistant would—an AI agent needs to learn on the job. In other words, it must retain a robust history of every AI-generated interaction and how it went.",
    "But to gather and retain that permanent memory of every interaction may be at odds with core notions of digital privacy in AI, especially when working with closed models deployed on the cloud (as opposed to deploying open sourced models locally).",
    "For instance, in April, OpenAI announced that ChatGPT will now automatically remember every conversation you have with it, in furtherance of OpenAI’s goal to develop “AI systems that get to know you over your life.” But notably, the feature was not made available in the EU, UK, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein—presumably because it runs afoul of their existing privacy laws and AI regulations.9",

But he wasnât the first to write about the concepts we now describe as AI. Alan Turing introduced the concept of the âimitation gameâ in a 1950 paper. Thatâs the test of a machineâs ability to exhibit intelligent behavior, now known as the âTuring test.â He believed researchers should focus on areas that donât require too much sensing and action, things like games and language translation. Research communities dedicated to concepts like computer vision, natural language understanding, and neural networks are, in many cases, several decades old.",

For example, we know a German shepherd is a dog, which is a mammal; all mammals are warm-blooded; therefore, a German shepherd should be warm-blooded.",
    "The main problem with symbolic AI is that humans still need to manually encode their knowledge of the world into the symbolic AI system, rather than allowing it to observe and encode relationships on its own. As a result, symbolic AI systems struggle with situations involving real-world complexity. They also lack the ability to learn from large amounts of data.",
    "Symbolic AI was the dominant paradigm of AI research until the late 1980s.",
    "Neural networks (1954, 1969, 1986, 2012). Neural networks are the technology behind the recent explosive growth of gen AI. Loosely modeling the ways neurons interact in the human brain, neural networks ingest data and process it through multiple iterations that learn increasingly complex features of the data. The neural network can then make determinations about the data, learn whether a determination is correct, and use what it has learned to make determinations about new data. For example, once it âlearnsâ what an object looks like, it can recognize the object in a new image.",
    "In 2012, Hinton and two of his students highlighted the power of deep learning. They applied Hintonâs algorithm to neural networks with many more layers than was typical, sparking a new focus on deep neural networks. These have been the main AI approaches of recent years.",
    "Traditional robotics (1968). During the first few decades of AI, researchers built robots to advance research. Some robots were mobile, moving around on wheels, while others were fixed, with articulated arms. Robots used the earliest attempts at computer vision to identify and navigate through their environments or to understand the geometry of objects and maneuver them. This could include moving around blocks of various shapes and colors. Most of these robots, just like the ones that have been used in factories for decades, rely on highly controlled environments with thoroughly scripted behaviors that they perform repeatedly. They have not contributed significantly to the advancement of AI itself.",
    "The term âartificial general intelligenceâ (AGI) was coined to describe AI systems that possess capabilities comparable to those of a human. In theory, AGI could someday replicate human-like cognitive abilities including reasoning, problem-solving, perception, learning, and language comprehension.

    "We have yet to see the longtail effect of gen AI models. This means there are some inherent risks involved in using themâboth known and unknown.",
    "The outputs gen AI models produce may often sound extremely convincing. This is by design. But sometimes the information they generate is just plain wrong. Worse, sometimes itâs biased (because itâs built on the gender, racial, and other biases of the internet and society more generally).",
    "It can also be manipulated to enable unethical or criminal activity. Since gen AI models burst onto the scene, organizations have become aware of users trying to âjailbreakâ the modelsâthat means trying to get them to break their own rules and deliver biased, harmful, misleading, or even illegal content. Gen AI organizations are responding to this threat in two ways: for one thing, theyâre collecting feedback from users on inappropriate content. Theyâre also combing through their databases, identifying prompts that led to inappropriate content, and training the model against these types of generations.",
    "But awareness and even action donât guarantee that harmful content wonât slip the dragnet. Organizations that rely on gen AI models should be aware of the reputational and legal risks involved in unintentionally publishing biased, offensive, or copyrighted content.",
    "These risks can be mitigated, however, in a few ways. âWhenever you use a model,â says McKinsey partner Marie El Hoyek, âyou need to be able to counter biasesÂ and instruct it not to use inappropriate or flawed sources, or things you donât trust.â How? For one thing, itâs crucial to carefully select the initial data used to train these models to avoid including toxic or biased content. Next, rather than employing an off-the-shelf gen AI model, organizations could consider using smaller, specialized models. Organizations with more resources could also customize a general model based on their own data to fit their needs and minimize biases.",
    "Itâs also important to keep a human in the loop (that is, to make sure a real human checks the output of a gen AI model before it is published or used) and avoid using gen AI models for critical decisions, such as those involving significant resources or human welfare.",
    "It canât be emphasized enough that this is a new field. The landscape of risks and opportunities is likely to continue to change rapidly in the coming years. As gen AI becomes increasingly incorporated into business, society, and our personal lives, we can also expect a new regulatory climate to take shape.

    "Businesses increasingly rely on artificial intelligence (AI) systems to make decisions that can significantly affect individual rights, human safety, and critical business operations. But how do these models derive their conclusions? What data do they use? And can we trust the results?",
    "Addressing these questions is the essence of âexplainability,â and getting it right is becoming essential. While many companies have begun adopting basic tools to understand how and why AI models render their insights, unlocking the full value of AI requires a comprehensive strategy. Our research finds that companies seeing the biggest bottom-line returns from AIâthose that attribute at least 20 percent of EBIT to their use of AIâare more likely than others to follow best practices that enable explainability.1âThe state of AI in 2021,â McKinsey, December 8, 2021. Further, organizations that establish digital trust among consumers through practices such as making AI explainable are more likely to see their annual revenue and EBIT grow at rates of 10 percent or more.2Jim Boehm, Liz Grennan, Alex Singla, and Kate Smaje, âWhy digital trust truly matters,â McKinsey, September 12, 2022.",
    "Even as explainability gains importance, it is becoming significantly harder. Modeling techniques that today power many AI applications, such as deep learning and neural networks, are inherently more difficult for humans to understand. For all the predictive insights AI can deliver, advanced machine learning engines often remain a black box. The solution isnât simply finding better ways to convey how a system works; rather, itâs about creating tools and processes that can help even the deep expert understand the outcome and then explain it to others.",
    "Explainability is the capacity to express why an AI system reached a particular decision, recommendation, or prediction. Developing this capability requires understanding how the AI model operates and the types of data used to train it. That sounds simple enough, but the more sophisticated an AI system becomes, the harder it is to pinpoint exactly how it derived a particular insight. AI engines get âsmarterâ over time by continually ingesting data, gauging the predictive power of different algorithmic combinations, and updating the resulting model. They do all this at blazing speeds, sometimes delivering outputs within fractions of a second.",
    "Disentangling a first-order insight and explaining how the AI went from A to B might be relatively easy. But as AI engines interpolate and reinterpolate data, the insight audit trail becomes harder to follow.",
    "Complicating matters, different consumers of the AI systemâs data have different explainability needs. A bank that uses an AI engine to support credit decisions will need to provide consumers who are denied a loan with a reason for that outcome. Loan officers and AI practitioners might need even more granular information to help them understand the risk factors and weightings used in rendering the decision to ensure the model is tuned optimally. And the risk function or diversity office may need to confirm that the data used in the AI engine are not biased against certain applicants. Regulators and other stakeholders also will have specific needs and interests.",
    "Organizations that build a framework for explainability and acquire the right enabling tools will be better positioned to capture the full value of deep learning and other AI advances. We suggest organizations start by including explainability as one of the key principles within their responsible AI guidelines. Then organizations can operationalize this principle by establishing an AI governanceÂ committee to set standards and guidance for AI development teams, including guidelines for use-case-specific review processes, and by investing in the right talent, technology, research, and training.",
    "Establishment of an AI governance committee includes recruiting its members and defining the scope of work. The explainability and risk assessment of AI use cases may be complex, requiring an understanding of the business objective, the intended users, the technology, and any applicable legal requirements. For this reason, organizations will want to convene a cross-functional set of experienced professionals, including business leaders, technical experts, and legal and risk professionals. Bringing in diverse points of view internally and externally can also help the company test whether the explanations developed to support an AI model are intuitive and effective for different audiences.",
    "A key function of the committee will be setting standards for AI explainability. As part of the standards-setting process, effective AI governance committees often establish a risk taxonomy that can be used to classify the sensitivity of different AI use cases. The taxonomy links to guidance that outlines expectations and standards with respect to different use cases. For example, is an explanation necessary to comply with regulatory requirements, or is the goal simply to provide an overview of functionality to aid adoption? The taxonomy also clarifies when escalation to a review board or legal may be required.",
    "Because each AI use case can present a different set of risks and legal requirements related to explainability, organizations should establish a process for model development teams to assess each use case. This process better positions the organization to manage these risks and capture value from AI. Tracking the outcome of these assessments within a central inventory helps ensure the organization can monitor the use of AI systems for compliance with law and adherence to responsible AI principles.",
    "As part of the review process, teams will need to consider whether to go beyond the basic explainability requirements, based on the potential value resulting from, for example, greater trust, adoption, or productivity. In some cases, a trade-off may exist between explainability and accuracy. For example, simplifying an AI modelâs mechanics might improve user trust, but in someânot allâcases, a shift might make the model less accurate. When trade-offs exist, teams will need to weigh the competing considerations, including any regulatory requirements, and escalate to leadership as necessary.",
    "Teams may be able to address these trade-offs themselves. Sometimes they can reverse-engineer the factors driving predictive outcomes for advanced AI models by tracking model performance and discerning patterns. They can then try to replicate the complex model using simpler and better-understood statistical methods such as logistic regression. In some cases, the result will be an equally high-performing model with outputs that are inherently explainable.",
    "High-performing organizations develop a talent strategy to support AI governance across the enterprise. These companies seek to retain legal and risk colleagues who can actively and meaningfully engage with both the business and technologists to navigate applicable regulations, meet consumer expectations, and âfuture-proofâ core products (including features and data sets) as the law evolves. Similarly, companies are well served to hire technologists familiar with legal issues or focused on technology ethics.",
    "Research is an ongoing requirement because legal and regulatory requirements, as well as consumer expectations and industry norms, are changing rapidly. AI governance committees will want to actively monitor and, where possible, conduct their own research in this space to ensure continual learning and knowledge development. The committee should also establish a training program to ensure employees across the organization understand and are able to apply the latest developments in this space.",
    "People use what they understand and trust. This is especially true of AI. The businesses that make it easy to show how their AI insights and recommendations are derived will come out ahead, not only with their organizationâs AI users, but also with regulators and consumersâand in terms of their bottom lines.",

Generative AI tools such as GitHub Copilot and Tabnine are also increasingly used to produce application code based on natural-language prompts. While these tools have shown early promise and interest among developers, they are unlikely to fully replace software engineers. Instead, they serve as useful productivity aids, automating repetitive tasks and boilerplate code writing.",
    "AI and machine learning are prominent buzzwords in security vendor marketing, so buyers should take a cautious approach. Still, AI is indeed a useful technology in multiple aspects of cybersecurity, including anomaly detection, reducing false positives and conducting behavioral threat analytics. For example, organizations use machine learning in security information and event management (SIEM) software to detect suspicious activity and potential threats. By analyzing vast amounts of data and recognizing patterns that resemble known malicious code, AI tools can alert security teams to new and emerging attacks, often much sooner than human employees and previous technologies could.",
    "In addition to AI's fundamental role in operating autonomous vehicles, AI technologies are used in automotive transportation to manage traffic, reduce congestion and enhance road safety.

    "The term artificial intelligence is closely linked to popular culture, which could create unrealistic expectations among the general public about AI's impact on work and daily life. A proposed alternative term, augmented intelligence, distinguishes machine systems that support humans from the fully autonomous systems found in science fiction -- think HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey or Skynet from the Terminator movies.",
    "While AI tools present a range of new functionalities for businesses, their use raises significant ethical questions. For better or worse, AI systems reinforce what they have already learned, meaning that these algorithms are highly dependent on the data they are trained on. Because a human being selects that training data, the potential for bias is inherent and must be monitored closely.",
    "Generative AI adds another layer of ethical complexity. These tools can produce highly realistic and convincing text, images and audio -- a useful capability for many legitimate applications, but also a potential vector of misinformation and harmful content such as deepfakes.",
    "Consequently, anyone looking to use machine learning in real-world production systems needs to factor ethics into their AI training processes and strive to avoid unwanted bias. This is especially important for AI algorithms that lack transparency, such as complex neural networks used in deep learning.",
    "Responsible AI refers to the development and implementation of safe, compliant and socially beneficial AI systems. It is driven by concerns about algorithmic bias, lack of transparency and unintended consequences. The concept is rooted in longstanding ideas from AI ethics, but gained prominence as generative AI tools became widely available -- and, consequently, their risks became more concerning. Integrating responsible AI principles into business strategies helps organizations mitigate risk and foster public trust.",
    "Explainability, or the ability to understand how an AI system makes decisions, is a growing area of interest in AI research. Lack of explainability presents a potential stumbling block to using AI in industries with strict regulatory compliance requirements. For example, fair lending laws require U.S. financial institutions to explain their credit-issuing decisions to loan and credit card applicants. When AI programs make such decisions, however, the subtle correlations among thousands of variables can create a black-box problem, where the system's decision-making process is opaque.",
    "In summary, AI's ethical challenges include the following:",
    "Despite potential risks, there are currently few regulations governing the use of AI tools, and many existing laws apply to AI indirectly rather than explicitly. For example, as previously mentioned, U.S. fair lending regulations such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act require financial institutions to explain credit decisions to potential customers. This limits the extent to which lenders can use deep learning algorithms, which by their nature are opaque and lack explainability.",
    "The European Union has been proactive in addressing AI governance. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) already imposes strict limits on how enterprises can use consumer data, affecting the training and functionality of many consumer-facing AI applications. In addition, the EU AI Act, which aims to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for AI development and deployment, went into effect in August 2024. The Act imposes varying levels of regulation on AI systems based on their riskiness, with areas such as biometrics and critical infrastructure receiving greater scrutiny.",
    "While the U.S. is making progress, the country still lacks dedicated federal legislation akin to the EU's AI Act. Policymakers have yet to issue comprehensive AI legislation, and existing federal-level regulations focus on specific use cases and risk management, complemented by state initiatives. That said, the EU's more stringent regulations could end up setting de facto standards for multinational companies based in the U.S., similar to how GDPR shaped the global data privacy landscape.",
    "With regard to specific U.S. AI policy developments, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy published a \"Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights\" in October 2022, providing guidance for businesses on how to implement ethical AI systems. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also called for AI regulations in a report released in March 2023, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that fosters competition while addressing risks.",
    "More recently, in October 2023, President Biden issued an executive order on the topic of secure and responsible AI development. Among other things, the order directed federal agencies to take certain actions to assess and manage AI risk and developers of powerful AI systems to report safety test results. The outcome of the upcoming U.S. presidential election is also likely to affect future AI regulation, as candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have espoused differing approaches to tech regulation.",
    "Crafting laws to regulate AI will not be easy, partly because AI comprises a variety of technologies used for different purposes, and partly because regulations can stifle AI progress and development, sparking industry backlash. The rapid evolution of AI technologies is another obstacle to forming meaningful regulations, as is AI's lack of transparency, which makes it difficult to understand how algorithms arrive at their results. Moreover, technology breakthroughs and novel applications such as ChatGPT and Dall-E can quickly render existing laws obsolete. And, of course, laws and other regulations are unlikely to deter malicious actors from using AI for harmful purposes.",
    "Throughout the centuries, thinkers from the Greek philosopher Aristotle to the 13th-century Spanish theologian Ramon Llull to mathematician René Descartes and statistician Thomas Bayes used the tools and logic of their times to describe human thought processes as symbols. Their work laid the foundation for AI concepts such as general knowledge representation and logical reasoning.",

In the 1930s, British mathematician and World War II codebreaker Alan Turing introduced the concept of a universal machine that could simulate any other machine. His theories were crucial to the development of digital computers and, eventually, AI.",
    "Princeton mathematician John Von Neumann conceived the architecture for the stored-program computer -- the idea that a computer's program and the data it processes can be kept in the computer's memory. Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts proposed a mathematical model of artificial neurons, laying the foundation for neural networks and other future AI developments.",
    "The modern field of AI is widely cited as beginning in 1956 during a summer conference at Dartmouth College. Sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the conference was attended by 10 luminaries in the field, including AI pioneers Marvin Minsky, Oliver Selfridge and John McCarthy, who is credited with coining the term \"artificial intelligence.\" Also in attendance were Allen Newell, a computer scientist, and Herbert A. Simon, an economist, political scientist and cognitive psychologist.",
    "The two presented their groundbreaking Logic Theorist, a computer program capable of proving certain mathematical theorems and often referred to as the first AI program. A year later, in 1957, Newell and Simon created the General Problem Solver algorithm that, despite failing to solve more complex problems, laid the foundations for developing more sophisticated cognitive architectures.",
    "In the wake of the Dartmouth College conference, leaders in the fledgling field of AI predicted that human-created intelligence equivalent to the human brain was around the corner, attracting major government and industry support. Indeed, nearly 20 years of well-funded basic research generated significant advances in AI. McCarthy developed Lisp, a language originally designed for AI programming that is still used today. In the mid-1960s, MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum developed Eliza, an early NLP program that laid the foundation for today's chatbots.",
    "In the 1970s, achieving AGI proved elusive, not imminent, due to limitations in computer processing and memory as well as the complexity of the problem. As a result, government and corporate support for AI research waned, leading to a fallow period lasting from 1974 to 1980 known as the first AI winter. During this time, the nascent field of AI saw a significant decline in funding and interest.",
    "In the 1980s, research on deep learning techniques and industry adoption of Edward Feigenbaum's expert systems sparked a new wave of AI enthusiasm. Expert systems, which use rule-based programs to mimic human experts' decision-making, were applied to tasks such as financial analysis and clinical diagnosis. However, because these systems remained costly and limited in their capabilities, AI's resurgence was short-lived, followed by another collapse of government funding and industry support. This period of reduced interest and investment, known as the second AI winter, lasted until the mid-1990s.",
    "Increases in computational power and an explosion of data sparked an AI renaissance in the mid- to late 1990s, setting the stage for the remarkable advances in AI we see today. The combination of big data and increased computational power propelled breakthroughs in NLP, computer vision, robotics, machine learning and deep learning. A notable milestone occurred in 1997, when Deep Blue defeated Kasparov, becoming the first computer program to beat a world chess champion.",

These include the launch of Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa voice assistants; IBM Watson's victories on Jeopardy; the development of self-driving features for cars; and the implementation of AI-based systems that detect cancers with a high degree of accuracy. The first generative adversarial network was developed, and Google launched TensorFlow, an open source machine learning framework that is widely used in AI development.",
    "A key milestone occurred in 2012 with the groundbreaking AlexNet, a convolutional neural network that significantly advanced the field of image recognition and popularized the use of GPUs for AI model training. In 2016, Google DeepMind's AlphaGo model defeated world Go champion Lee Sedol, showcasing AI's ability to master complex strategic games. The previous year saw the founding of research lab OpenAI, which would make important strides in the second half of that decade in reinforcement learning and NLP.",
    "The current decade has so far been dominated by the advent of generative AI, which can produce new content based on a user's prompt. These prompts often take the form of text, but they can also be images, videos, design blueprints, music or any other input that the AI system can process. Output content can range from essays to problem-solving explanations to realistic images based on pictures of a person.",
    "In 2020, OpenAI released the third iteration of its GPT language model, but the technology did not reach widespread awareness until 2022. That year, the generative AI wave began with the launch of image generators Dall-E 2 and Midjourney in April and July, respectively. The excitement and hype reached full force with the general release of ChatGPT that November.",
    "Generative AI technology is still in its early stages, as evidenced by its ongoing tendency to hallucinate and the continuing search for practical, cost-effective applications. But regardless, these developments have brought AI into the public conversation in a new way, leading to both excitement and trepidation.",
    "AI tools and services are evolving at a rapid rate. Current innovations can be traced back to the 2012 AlexNet neural network, which ushered in a new era of high-performance AI built on GPUs and large data sets. The key advancement was the discovery that neural networks could be trained on massive amounts of data across multiple GPU cores in parallel, making the training process more scalable.",
    "In the 21st century, a symbiotic relationship has developed between algorithmic advancements at organizations like Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, on the one hand, and the hardware innovations pioneered by infrastructure providers like Nvidia, on the other.

    "Early AI systems were rule-based computer programs that could solve somewhat complex problems. Instead of hardcoding every decision the software was supposed to make, the program was divided into a knowledge base and an inference engine. Developers filled out the knowledge base with facts, and the inference engine then queried those facts to get results.",
    "This type of AI was limited because it relied heavily on human intervention and input. Rule-based systems lack the flexibility to learn and evolve, and they're hardly considered intelligent anymore.",
    "Modern types of AI and AI algorithms learn from historical data. This makes them useful for applications such as robotics, self-driving cars, power grid optimization and natural language understanding (NLU). While AI sometimes yields superhuman performance in these fields, it still has a way to go before it competes with human intelligence.",
    "For now, AI can't learn the way humans do -- that is, with just a few examples. AI must be trained on huge amounts of data to understand a topic. Algorithms can't transfer their understanding of one domain to another. For instance, people who learn a game such as StarCraft can quickly learn to play StarCraft II. But for AI, StarCraft II is a whole new world; it must learn each game from scratch.",
    "Human intelligence can link meanings. For instance, consider the word human. People can identify humans in pictures and videos. AI has also gained that capability. But people also know what to expect from humans. They never expect a human to have four wheels and emit carbon like a car. An AI system, on the other hand, can't figure this out unless trained on a lot of data.",
    "AI's definition is a moving target. For instance, optical character recognition used to be considered advanced AI, but it no longer is. However, a deep learning algorithm trained on thousands of handwriting examples that can convert those to text is considered advanced by today's definition.",
    "People were amazed when AI algorithms got so sophisticated that they outperformed expert human radiologists. But later we learned about their limitations. That's why we now distinguish between the narrow or weak AI and the human-level version of AI that computer and data scientists are now pursuing: artificial general intelligence (AGI). Every AI application that exists falls under narrow AI, while AGI is a theoretical goal.",
    "Businesses across various vertical markets use general-purpose AI. Different algorithms are suited to different tasks as follows:",
    "Machine learning is a subset of AI; it's one of the AI algorithms we've developed to mimic human intelligence. ML is an advancement on symbolic AI, also known as \"good old-fashioned\" AI, which is based on rule-based systems that use if-then conditions.",
    "The advent of ML marked a turning point in AI development. Before ML, we tried to teach computers all the variables of every decision they had to make. This made the process fully visible, and the algorithm could take care of many complex scenarios.",
    "In its most complex form, the AI would traverse several decision branches and find the one with the best results. That is how IBM's Deep Blue was designed to beat Garry Kasparov at chess.",
    "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses complex neural networks to replicate human intelligence. The idea of building AI based on neural networks has been around since the 1980s, but it wasn't until 2012 that deep learning got traction. While machine learning was predicated on the vast amounts of data being produced at the time, deep learning owes its adoption to the cheaper computing power that became available as well as advancements in algorithms.",
    "Deep learning enabled smarter results than were originally possible with ML. Consider the complex considerations that go into learning facial recognition. To detect a face, AI needs specific labeled data on facial features to learn what to look for. Deep learning makes use of layers of information processing, each gradually learning more complex representations of data. The early layers might learn about colors, the next ones about shapes, the following ones about combinations of those shapes, and the final layers about actual objects.",
    "Deep learning demonstrated a breakthrough in object recognition. Its invention quickly advanced AI on several fronts, including NLU. It's currently the most sophisticated AI architecture available. Deep learning algorithms include CNNs, recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory networks, deep belief networks and generative adversarial networks.",
    "Machine learning and deep learning both represent milestones in AI's evolution. Both require advanced hardware to run, like high-end GPUs and access to a lot of power. However, deep learning models typically learn faster and are more autonomous than ML models.",
    "Aside from these differences, AI, machine learning and deep learning have the following similarities:",
    "Data quality and diversity are important factors in each form of AI. Diverse data sets mitigate inherent biases embedded in the training data that can lead to skewed outputs. High-quality data minimizes errors to ensure models are reliable. Like humans, an AI model must learn iteratively to improve its predictive, problem-solving and decision-making capabilities over time.",

    "Companies are increasingly interested in these demanding AI technologies because of their potential to reinvent critical business processes in ways that other forms of enterprise IT can't -- through intelligent automation, optimization, cost reduction and improved decision-making. Indeed, McKinsey's latest annual research on the state of enterprise AI found that its use is surging: Fueled by generative AI, business adoption of AI jumped to 72% of surveyed organizations in 2024, up from about 50% in each of the past six years. Half the organizations surveyed said they've adopted AI in two or more business functions, up from a third in 2023.",
    "But the risks associated with integrating AI technologies into existing business systems and processes are substantial, and developing the metrics to ensure AI success has been challenging. These obstacles are due not only to the complexity of the AI tools themselves but also to the nature of enterprise systems per se. Enterprise systems, whether traditional or cutting edge, must be scalable, dependable, secure, smoothly integrated into workflows and accepted by employees. In addition, AI talent is scarce and expensive.",
    "Enterprise AI is also subject to hype and awash in newly developed tools and services from AI vendors. Which approaches will become the standard baseline technologies is still unnervingly uncertain. What should companies do to ensure their adoption of enterprise AI drives revenue and becomes a competitive differentiator?",

It is hard to think of an area in the enterprise where AI won't have an impact. However, enterprise leaders determined to use AI to improve their businesses and ensure a return on their investment face these overarching challenges:",
    "To reap the value of AI in the enterprise, business leaders must understand how AI works, where AI technologies can be aptly applied in their businesses and where they cannot -- a daunting task that starts with the need for effective data management.",
    "The value of AI to 21st-century businesses has been compared to the strategic value of electricity in the early 20th century when electrification transformed industries like manufacturing and created new ones such as mass communications. \"AI is strategic because the scale, scope, complexity and the dynamism in business today is so extreme that humans can no longer manage it without artificial intelligence,\" Chris Brahm, senior advisory partner at Bain & Company, told TechTarget.",
    "In the near term, AI's biggest impact on small businesses and large companies alike stems from its ability to automate and augment jobs that today are done by humans.",
    "Labor gains realized from using AI are expected to expand upon and surpass those made by current workplace automation tools. And by analyzing vast volumes of data, AI won't simply automate work tasks but will generate the most efficient way to complete a task and adjust workflows on the fly as circumstances change.",
    "AI is already augmenting human work in many fields. For example, augmented intelligence capabilities assist doctors in medical diagnoses and help contact center workers deal more effectively with customer queries and complaints. In security, AI is being used to automatically respond to cybersecurity threats and prioritize those that need human attention. Project managers are using AI-powered software to prioritize and schedule work, estimate costs and allocate resources. IT teams are using AIOps to automate the identification and resolution of common IT issues. Banks are using AI to speed up and support loan processing and to ensure compliance.",
    "The advent of generative AI dramatically expands the type of jobs AI can automate and augment. Businesses and consumers have quickly adopted GenAI technology, using applications such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Copilot to conduct searches, create art, compose essays, write code and make conversation.",
    "While enterprise AI is creating new jobs, such as AI product managers, AI engineers and AI ethics officers, its potential to eliminate many jobs done today by humans is of major concern to workers, as described in the following sections on benefits and risks of AI.",
    "Artificial intelligence is the simulation by computer systems of how our brains learn, reason, self-correct and create. As explained in TechTarget's comprehensive definition of artificial intelligence, AI systems generally work by ingesting large amounts of training data, analyzing that data for correlations and patterns and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. Learning involves creating rules, or algorithms, with instructions for AI tools on how to complete specific tasks; reasoning is their ability to choose the right algorithm for the job; self-correction is AI's capacity to continuously learn and adapt based on new data; creativity involves making new content from existing data. There also are four types of AI: reactive, limited memory, theory of mind and self-aware.",
    "The embrace of enterprise AI for its potential to drive growth, innovation and other business advantages is near universal. In a 2024 \"AI in the Enterprise Survey\" commissioned by digital transformation company UST, for example, 93% of 600 senior IT decision-makers at large companies said AI is essential to success. A late 2023 survey conducted for research firm Frost & Sullivan's \"Global State of AI, 2024\" report found that 89% of organizations in multiple industry verticals believe AI and machine learning will help them achieve their business priorities. Other surveys report similar levels of enthusiasm for AI among business and IT leaders.",
    "Increasing revenue and improving operational efficiency are key drivers for investments in AI. Here are some additional widely cited benefits of AI for businesses:",
    "Some of the challenges and risks associated with enterprise AI stem from the same mistakes that can sabotage any technology deployment: inadequate planning, insufficient skill sets, lack of alignment with business goals and poor communication.",
    "For these types of issues, companies should lean on the best practices that have guided the effective adoption of other new technologies. But AI also comes with unique risks that many organizations are ill-equipped to deal with -- or even recognize -- due to the nature of the technology and how fast it is evolving.",
    "One of the biggest barriers to effectively using AI in the enterprise is well documented: worker mistrust. Professional services firm KPMG found that 61% of the respondents to its \"Trust in Artificial Intelligence: Global Insights 2023\" survey were either ambivalent about or unwilling to trust AI. A 2024 Salesforce survey of nearly 6,000 knowledge workers worldwide showed that 56% of AI users found it difficult to get what they wanted from the technology and 54% said they didn't trust the data used to train AI systems, putting increased AI adoption by those users at risk.",
    "Dispelling mistrust of AI is easier said than done, as shown by the following current weaknesses inherent in AI technologies.",
    "Unintentional bias. Like any data-driven tool, AI algorithms depend on the quality of data used to train the AI model. Therefore, they are subject to biases inherent in the data, leading to faulty results, socially inappropriate responses and even greater mistrust.",
    "Unexplainable results. Unexplainable results are a significant challenge in AI systems due to their inherent black box nature. Explainability -- understanding how an algorithm reaches its conclusion -- is not always possible with AI systems, given the way they are configured with many hidden layers that self-organize the weights used as parameters to create a response.",
    "Hallucinations. An algorithm's behavior, or output, in a so-called deterministic environment can be predicted from the input. Most AI systems today are stochastic or probabilistic, meaning they rely on statistical models and techniques to generate responses that the algorithm deems probable in a given scenario. But the results are sometimes fantasy, as experienced by many users of ChatGPT, and are referred to as AI hallucinations.",
    "The adoption of shadow AI -- the unauthorized use of AI tools at work -- is another risk enterprises must address. The \"2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report\" from Microsoft and LinkedIn, released in May 2024, found that 78% of AI users are bringing their own AI tools to work, highlighting the need to develop AI governance polices.",
    "Other risks that companies must confront include running afoul of AI laws and proposed regulations; the malicious use of AI to automate and amplify cyberattacks; and the potential for internal morale issues and social unrest due to AI-induced job losses. While some jobs are likely immune to being replaced by AI, many others could increasingly be taken over by the technology.",
    "AI and big data play a symbiotic role in 21st-century business success. Large data sets, including a combination of structured, semistructured and unstructured data, are the raw material for yielding the in-depth business intelligence and analytics that drive improvements in existing business operations and lead to new business opportunities. Companies cannot fully capitalize on these vast data stores, however, without the help of AI. For example, deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks to process large data sets and identify subtle patterns and correlations that can give companies a competitive edge.",
    "Simultaneously, AI relies on big data for training and generating insights. AI's ability to make meaningful predictions -- to get at the truth of a matter rather than mimic human biases -- requires not only vast stores of data but also data of high quality. Cloud computing environments have helped enable AI applications by providing the computational power needed to process and manage the required data in a scalable and flexible architecture. In addition, the cloud provides wider access to enterprise users, democratizing AI capabilities.",

    "Many computer-assisted tasks in the enterprise are not automatic but require a certain amount of intelligence. What qualifies as an intelligent machine, however, is a moving target. Use cases once considered to require AI, such as basic data cleansing or simple demand forecasting, quickly became standard data processing practices as advanced computational techniques were rolled into widely available tools. More recently, the previously complex AI problem known as lemmatization -- reducing a word to its root form to improve accuracy in NLP -- has now become a standard feature of NLP pipelines. Here are three areas where rapidly evolving AI techniques, alone and in combination, are creating new enterprise AI use cases in real time:",
    "Enterprise leaders responsible for setting AI strategy should be familiar with three AI concepts: narrow AI, also known as weak AI; artificial general intelligence (AGI); and artificial superintelligence (ASI).",
    "Narrow AI accounts for most of the AI applications today. It refers to models trained to perform specific tasks, such as language translation, spam filtering and image recognition. Intelligent agents like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa, the recommendation engines used by Netflix and Amazon, Tesla's Autopilot and Google Photos are examples of narrow AI.",
    "Artificial general intelligence is generally defined as AI capable of performing any intellectual task a human being can do, including the ability to reason about and think up complex problems it was not programmed to solve. This capacity to think like humans does not exist today. How close we are to achieving AGI is a matter of heated debate.",
    "Artificial superintelligence refers to AI that possesses intellectual powers exceeding those of humans across a wide range of categories and endeavors. It also does not exist. AI programs like the chess engine Stockfish that are superior to humans in a single domain fall well short of ASI. The singularity, an idea popularized by futurist Ray Kurzweil, refers to a hypothetical future in which AI acquires a superhuman level of intelligence that is out of control and irreversible.",

    "The following is a rundown of some current AI developments, which are described in more depth in this article on top AI and machine learning trends:",
    "As AI becomes incorporated into enterprise systems and more widely adopted by the public, the need for better understanding of AI risks has increased. This has led to calls for responsible AI and trustworthy AI. For example, NIST defines AI systems that are trustworthy as having the following characteristics: \"valid and reliable, safe, secure and resilient, accountable and transparent, explainable and interpretable, privacy-enhanced, and fair with harmful bias managed.\"",
    "However, the extreme rapidity of AI tool adoption and its ongoing technical evolution makes it extremely difficult to pin down what exactly responsible AI usage means.",

It remains to be seen whether these regulations will be able to guard against the potential ill effects of AI -- a list that includes job loss, bias and discrimination, misinformation, theft of intellectual property and enhanced cyberattacks. Moreover, there is a risk that such regulation could stifle innovation and damage the financial advantages that AI potentially offers.",
    "One of the characteristics that has set us humans apart over our several-hundred-thousand-year history on Earth is a unique reliance on tools and a determination to improve upon the tools we invent. Once we figured out how to make AI work, it was inevitable that AI tools would become increasingly intelligent. What is the future of AI? It will be intertwined with the future of everything we do. Indeed, it will not be long before AI's novelty in the realm of work will be no greater than that of a hammer or plow.",
    "This synergy is not likely to stop anytime soon. Arguably, the very distinction between what is human intelligence and what is artificial will probably evaporate. This blurring between human and artificial intelligence is occurring because of other trends in technology, which incidentally have been spurred by AI. These include brain-machine interfaces that skip the requirement for verbal communication altogether, robotics that give machines all the capabilities of human action, and a deeper understanding of the physical basis of human intelligence thanks to new approaches to unravel the wiring diagrams of actual brains.",
    "The modern field of AI is often dated to 1956, when the term artificial intelligence was included in the proposal for an academic conference held at Dartmouth College that year. But the idea that the human brain can be mechanized is deeply rooted in human history.",

Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, a machine learning model uses algorithms to identify patterns within data and improve its performance over time without human intervention.",
    "Generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence designed to create new content, whether it's text, images, music, or even video. Unlike traditional AI, which typically focuses on analyzing and classifying data, generative AI goes a step further by using patterns it has learned from large datasets to generate new, original outputs. Essentially, it \"creates\" rather than just \"recognizes.\"",

    "AI can be classified into two main categories based on its capabilities and functionalities.",
    "To read about Types of AI in detail, refer to article: Types of AI.",
    "AI models are computer programs that learn to perform tasks by recognizing patterns in data, similar to how our brains learn from experience. They are trained on large datasets and then use what they’ve learned to make decisions, whether it’s identifying faces in a photo, translating languages or generating text.",
    "There are different kinds of AI models based on how they learn:",
    "In Supervised learning, the AI is provided with a set of examples where both the input and the desired output are known. For example, to teach an AI to recognize handwritten numbers, we would show it many images of handwritten digits, each labeled with the correct number (0-9). Over time, the model adjusts its internal settings (called weights) to minimize the difference between its predictions and the correct labels given by the \"teacher.\" This method works well when you have large amounts of high-quality, labeled data and is commonly used for tasks like image classification, speech recognition and spam detection.",
    "In Unsupervised Learning models, the AI is given input data without labels or explicit instructions on what to look for. Its task is to find hidden patterns, clusters, or structures on its own. For instance, if you give an unsupervised model a collection of news articles, it might automatically group them into categories like sports, politics, or entertainment, without anyone telling it those categories. This type of learning is helpful for uncovering new insights in data, reducing dimensions for visualization, and spotting unusual patterns, such as fraud or other anomalies.",
    "Reinforcement learning works differently from the other two methods. In this case, there isn’t a teacher providing the “correct” answer. Instead, the AI learns through a system of rewards and penalties. For example, in a video game, an agent might start by making random movements and gradually learn which actions lead to winning by receiving points or rewards. Over time, the model develops a strategy (or policy) to maximize its rewards. This type of learning is used in fields like robotics, game-playing (such as AlphaGo), and even automated trading systems.",
    "The widespread use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought numerous advantages across various sectors and aspects of our daily lives. Here are some of the primary benefits of AI:",
    "To read about Applications of AI in detail, refer to our article: Application of Artificial Intelligence.",
    "For example, we may collect information that's publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google's AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps and Cloud AI capabilities.

  "query": "what is tokenization",
  "answer": "Web3 applications rely on a process called tokenization. In this case, tokenization is a digitization process to make assets more accessible. (AI models and new modes of payments also use a process called tokenization, both of which have little to do with Web3 tokenizationâor each other, for that matter. In payments, tokenization is used for cybersecurity and to obfuscate the identity of the payment itself, essentially to prevent fraud. For a detailed description of tokenization in AI, see sidebar, âHow does tokenization work in AI?â)"

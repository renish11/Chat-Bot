  "A neural network is a machine learning (ML) model designed to process data in a way that mimics the function and structure of the human brain. Neural networks are intricate networks of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, that collaborate to tackle complicated problems.",
  "Prime uses involve any process that operates according to strict rules or patterns and has large amounts of data. If the data involved is too large for a human to make sense of in a reasonable amount of time, the process is likely a prime candidate for automation through artificial neural networks.",
  "Typically, an ANN is initially trained, or fed large amounts of data. Training consists of providing input and telling the network what the output should be. For example, to build a network that identifies the faces of actors, the initial training might be a series of pictures, including actors, non-actors, masks, statues and animal faces. Each input is accompanied by matching identification, such as actors' names or \"not actor\" or \"not human\" information. Providing the answers enables the model to adjust its internal weightings to do its job better.",
  "In defining the rules and making determinations -- the decisions of each node on what to send to the next layer based on inputs from the previous tier -- neural networks use several principles. These include gradient-based training, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms and Bayesian methods. They might be given some basic rules about object relationships in the data being modeled.",
  "Further, the assumptions people make when training algorithms cause neural networks to amplify cultural biases. Biased data sets are an ongoing challenge in training systems that find answers on their own through pattern recognition in data. If the data feeding the algorithm isn't neutral -- and almost no data is -- the machine propagates bias.",
  "Neural networks are sometimes described in terms of their depth, including how many layers they have between input and output, or the model's so-called hidden layers. This is why the term neural network is used almost synonymously with deep learning. Neural networks can also be described by the number of hidden nodes the model has, or in terms of how many input layers and output layers each node has. Variations on the classic neural network design enable various forms of forward and backward propagation of information among tiers.",
  "One of the simplest variants of neural networks, these pass information in one direction, through various input nodes, until it makes it to the output node. The network might or might not have hidden node layers, making their functioning more interpretable. It's prepared to process large amounts of noise. This type of ANN computational model is used in technologies such as facial recognition and computer vision.",
  "More complex in nature, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) save the output of processing nodes and feed the result back into the model. This is how the model learns to predict the outcome of a layer. Each node in the RNN model acts as a memory cell, continuing the computation and execution of operations.",
  "This neural network starts with the same front propagation as a feed-forward network, but then goes on to remember all processed information to reuse it in the future. If the network's prediction is incorrect, then the system self-learns and continues working toward the correct prediction during backpropagation. This type of ANN is frequently used in text-to-speech conversions.",
  "These represent the most basic form of neural networks and were introduced in 1958 by Frank Rosenblatt, an American psychologist who's also considered to be the father of deep learning. The perceptron is specifically designed for binary classification tasks, enabling it to differentiate between two classes based on input data.",
  "Transformer neural networks have gained popularity as an alternative to CNNs and RNNs because their \"attention mechanism\" enables them to capture and process multiple elements in a sequence simultaneously, which is a distinct advantage over other neural network architectures.",

  "Deep learning is in fact a new name for an approach to artificial intelligence called neural networks, which have been going in and out of fashion for more than 70 years. Neural networks were first proposed in 1944 by Warren McCullough and Walter Pitts, two University of Chicago researchers who moved to MIT in 1952 as founding members of what’s sometimes called the first cognitive science department.",
  "To each of its incoming connections, a node will assign a number known as a “weight.” When the network is active, the node receives a different data item — a different number — over each of its connections and multiplies it by the associated weight. It then adds the resulting products together, yielding a single number. If that number is below a threshold value, the node passes no data to the next layer. If the number exceeds the threshold value, the node “fires,” which in today’s neural nets generally means sending the number — the sum of the weighted inputs — along all its outgoing connections.",
  "But intellectually, there’s something unsatisfying about neural nets. Enough training may revise a network’s settings to the point that it can usefully classify data, but what do those settings mean? What image features is an object recognizer looking at, and how does it piece them together into the distinctive visual signatures of cars, houses, and coffee cups? Looking at the weights of individual connections won’t answer that question.",
  "The recent resurgence in neural networks — the deep-learning revolution — comes courtesy of the computer-game industry. The complex imagery and rapid pace of today’s video games require hardware that can keep up, and the result has been the graphics processing unit (GPU), which packs thousands of relatively simple processing cores on a single chip. It didn’t take long for researchers to realize that the architecture of a GPU is remarkably like that of a neural net.",
  "Modern GPUs enabled the one-layer networks of the 1960s and the two- to three-layer networks of the 1980s to blossom into the 10-, 15-, even 50-layer networks of today. That’s what the “deep” in “deep learning” refers to — the depth of the network’s layers. And currently, deep learning is responsible for the best-performing systems in almost every area of artificial-intelligence research.",

  "Non-linear activation function: A non-linear activation function is applied to the output of a neuron to introduce non-linearity into the network. Non-linearity is important because it allows the network to model complex, nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs. Common activation functions used in neural networks include the sigmoid function, the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function, and the softmax function.",
  "Loss function: This is a mathematical function that measures the error or difference between the predicted output of the neural network and the true output. The empirical loss measures the total loss over our entire dataset. Cross-entropy loss is commonly used with models that output a probability between 0 and 1, while mean squared error loss is used with regression models that output continuous real numbers. The goal is to minimize the loss function during training in order to improve the accuracy of the network’s predictions.",

  "Deconvolutional neural networks simply work in reverse of convolutional neural networks. The application of the network is to detect items that might have been recognized as important under a convolutional neural network. These items would likely have been discarded during the convolutional neural network execution process. This type of neural network is also widely used for image analysis or processing.",
  "Modular neural networks contain several networks that work independently from one another. These networks do not interact with each other during an analysis process. Instead, these processes are done to allow complex, elaborate computing processes to be done more efficiently. Similar to other modular industries such as modular real estate, the goal of the network independence is to have each module responsible for a particular part of an overall bigger picture.",
  "A neural network evaluates price data and unearths opportunities for making trade decisions based on the data analysis. The networks can distinguish subtle nonlinear interdependencies and patterns other methods of technical analysis cannot. According to research, the accuracy of neural networks in making price predictions for stocks differs. Some models predict the correct stock prices 50 to 60% of the time. Still, others have posited that a 10% improvement in efficiency is all an investor can ask for from a neural network.",
  "There will always be data sets and task classes that a better analyzed by using previously developed algorithms. It is not so much the algorithm that matters; it is the well-prepared input data on the targeted indicator that ultimately determines the level of success of a neural network.",
  "Though neutral networks may rely on online platforms, there is still a hardware component that is required to create the neural network. This creates a physical risk of the network that relies on complex systems, set-up requirements, and potential physical maintenance.",
  "Though the complexity of neural networks is a strength, this may mean it takes months (if not longer) to develop a specific algorithm for a specific task. In addition, it may be difficult to spot any errors or deficiencies in the process, especially if the results are estimates or theoretical ranges.",
  "Neural networks may also be difficult to audit. Some neural network processes may feel \"like a black box\" where input is entered, networks perform complicated processes, and output is reported. It may also be difficult for individuals to analyze weaknesses within the calculation or learning process of the network if the network lacks general transparency on how a model learns upon prior activity.",
  "What Are the Components of a Neural Network?",
  "What Is a Deep Neural Network?",

Deep neural networks rely on machine learning networks that continually evolve by compared estimated outcomes to actual results, then modifying future projections.",
  "What Are the 3 Components of a Neural Network?",
  "All neural networks have three main components. First, the input is the data entered into the network that is to be analyzed. Second, the processing layer utilizes the data (and prior knowledge of similar data sets) to formulate an expected outcome. That outcome is the third component, and this third component is the desired end product from the analysis.",

  "Neural networks can adapt to changing input; so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria. The concept of neural networks, which has its roots in artificial intelligence, is swiftly gaining popularity in the development of trading systems.",
  "A neural network works similarly to the human brain’s neural network. A “neuron” in a neural network is a mathematical function that collects and classifies information according to a specific architecture. The network bears a strong resemblance to statistical methods such as curve fitting and regression analysis.",
  "A neural network contains layers of interconnected nodes. Each node is a known as perceptron and is similar to a multiple linear regression. The perceptron feeds the signal produced by a multiple linear regression into an activation function that may be nonlinear.",
  "Even though there was a dry spell of research (largely due to a dry spell in funding) during the 1970's, Paul Werbos is often credited with the primary contribution during this time in his PhD thesis. Then, Jon Hopfield presented Hopfield Net, a paper on recurrent neural networks in 1982. In addition, the concept of backpropagation resurfaced, and many researchers began to understand its potential for neural nets.",
  "Recent analysis from the Los Alamos National Library allows analysts to compare different neural networks. The paper is considered an important part in moving towards characterizing the behavior of robust neural networks.",
  "Hidden layers fine-tune the input weightings until the neural network’s margin of error is minimal. It is hypothesized that hidden layers extrapolate salient features in the input data that have predictive power regarding the outputs. This describes feature extraction, which accomplishes a utility similar to statistical techniques such as principal component analysis.",
  "This becomes especially critical for networks in which the prediction is incorrect; the system will attempt to learn why the correct outcome occurred and adjust accordingly. This type of neural network is often used in text-to-speech applications.",
  "Convolutional neural networks, also called ConvNets or CNNs, have several layers in which data is sorted into categories. These networks have an input layer, an output layer, and a hidden multitude of convolutional layers in between. The layers create feature maps that record areas of an image that are broken down further until they generate valuable outputs. These layers can be pooled or entirely connected, and these networks are especially beneficial for image recognition applications.",
  "Deconvolutional neural networks simply work in reverse of convolutional neural networks. The application of the network is to detect items that might have been recognized as important under a convolutional neural network. These items would likely have been discarded during the convolutional neural network execution process. This type of neural network is also widely used for image analysis or processing.",
  "Modular neural networks contain several networks that work independently from one another. These networks do not interact with each other during an analysis process. Instead, these processes are done to allow complex, elaborate computing processes to be done more efficiently. Similar to other modular industries such as modular real estate, the goal of the network independence is to have each module responsible for a particular part of an overall bigger picture.",
  "A neural network evaluates price data and unearths opportunities for making trade decisions based on the data analysis. The networks can distinguish subtle nonlinear interdependencies and patterns other methods of technical analysis cannot. According to research, the accuracy of neural networks in making price predictions for stocks differs. Some models predict the correct stock prices 50 to 60% of the time. Still, others have posited that a 10% improvement in efficiency is all an investor can ask for from a neural network.",
  "There will always be data sets and task classes that a better analyzed by using previously developed algorithms. It is not so much the algorithm that matters; it is the well-prepared input data on the targeted indicator that ultimately determines the level of success of a neural network.",
  "Though neutral networks may rely on online platforms, there is still a hardware component that is required to create the neural network. This creates a physical risk of the network that relies on complex systems, set-up requirements, and potential physical maintenance.",
  "Though the complexity of neural networks is a strength, this may mean it takes months (if not longer) to develop a specific algorithm for a specific task. In addition, it may be difficult to spot any errors or deficiencies in the process, especially if the results are estimates or theoretical ranges.",
  "Neural networks may also be difficult to audit. Some neural network processes may feel \"like a black box\" where input is entered, networks perform complicated processes, and output is reported. It may also be difficult for individuals to analyze weaknesses within the calculation or learning process of the network if the network lacks general transparency on how a model learns upon prior activity.",
  "What Are the Components of a Neural Network?",
  "What Is a Deep Neural Network?",
  "Also known as a deep learning network, a deep neural network, at its most basic, is one that involves two or more processing layers. Deep neural networks rely on machine learning networks that continually evolve by compared estimated outcomes to actual results, then modifying future projections.",
  "What Are the 3 Components of a Neural Network?",
  "All neural networks have three main components. First, the input is the data entered into the network that is to be analyzed. Second, the processing layer utilizes the data (and prior knowledge of similar data sets) to formulate an expected outcome. That outcome is the third component, and this third component is the desired end product from the analysis.",
  "An artificial neural network is a biologically inspired computational model that is patterned after the network of neurons present in the human brain. Artificial neural networks can also be thought of as learning algorithms that model the input-output relationship. Applications of artificial neural networks include pattern recognition and forecasting in fields such as medicine, business, pure sciences, data mining, telecommunications, and operations managements.",
  "An artificial neural network transforms input data by applying a nonlinear function to a weighted sum of the inputs. The transformation is known as a neural layer and the function is referred to as a neural unit. The intermediate outputs of one layer, called features, are used as the input into the next layer. The neural network through repeated transformations learns multiple layers of nonlinear features (like edges and shapes), which it then combines in a final layer to create a prediction (of more complex objects). The neural net learns by varying the weights or parameters of a network so as to minimize the difference between the predictions of the neural network and the desired values. This phase where the artificial neural network learns from the data is called training.",
  "Neural networks where information is only fed forward from one layer to the next are called feedforward neural networks. On the other hand, the class of networks that has memory or feedback loops is called Recurrent Neural Networks.",
  "A layer is a container that usually receives weighted input, transforms it with a set of mostly nonlinear functions and then passes these values as output to the next layer in the neural net. A layer is usually uniform, that is it only contains one type of activation function, pooling, convolution etc. so that it can be easily compared to other parts of the neural network.",
  "A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural network that has memory or feedback loops that allow it to better recognize patterns in data. RNNs are an extension of regular artificial neural networks that add connections feeding the hidden layers of the neural network back into themselves - these are called recurrent connections. The recurrent connections provide a recurrent network with visibility of not just the current data sample it has been provided, but also it's previous hidden state. A recurrent network with a feedback loop can be visualized as multiple copies of a neural network, with the output of one serving as an input to the next. Unlike traditional neural networks, recurrent nets use their understanding of past events to process the input vector rather than starting from scratch every time.",
  "A RNN is particularly useful when a sequence of data is being processed to make a classification decision or regression estimate but it can also be used on non-sequential data. Recurrent neural networks are typically used to solve tasks related to time series data. Applications of recurrent neural networks include natural language processing, speech recognition, machine translation, character-level language modeling, image classification, image captioning, stock prediction, and financial engineering. We can teach RNNs to learn and understand sequences of words. RNNs can also be used to generate sequences mimicking everything from Shakespeare to Linux source code, to baby names.",
  "Some types of recurrent neural networks have a memory that enables them to remember important events that happened many time steps in the past. What distinguishes sequence learning from other regression and classification tasks is the need to use models such as LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) to learn temporal dependence in input data. This memory of past input is crucial for successful sequence learning.",
  "We can feed the recurrent nets with data sequences of arbitrary length, one element of the sequence per time step - A video input to a RNN for example would be fed one frame at a time. Another example is that of binary addition which could either be done using either a regular feed-forward neural network or an RNN. For the feedforward network we would need to choose the maximum number of digits in each binary number in advance and would also not be able to apply the knowledge learned about adding digits at the beginning of the vector to the digits at the end of the vector.",
  "Machine translation refers to the translation, using a machine, of a source sequence (sentence, paragraph, document) in one language to a corresponding target sequence or vector in another language. Since one source sentence can be translated in many different ways, the translation is essentially one-to-many, and the translation function is modeled as conditional rather than deterministic. In Neural machine translation (NMT), we let a neural network learn how to do the translation from data rather than from a set of designed rules. Since we are dealing with time series data where the context and order of words is important, the network of choice for NMT is a recurrent neural network. An NMT can be augmented with a technique called attention, which helps the model drive its focus onto important parts of the input and improve the prediction process.",
  "Like multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks can also be trained using the stochastic gradient descent (SGD), batch gradient descent, or mini-batch gradient descent algorithms. The only difference is in the back-propagation step that computes the weight updates for our slightly more complex network structure. After the error in the prediction is calculated in the first pass through the network, the error gradient, starting at the last output neuron, is computed and back-propagated to the hidden units for that time-step. This process is then repeated for each of the previous time-steps in order. The gradients that back-propagate to the hidden units are coming from both the output neurons and the units in the hidden state one step ahead in the sequence. We call this process Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT).",
  "We can increase the number of neurons in the hidden layer and we can stack multiple hidden layers to create a deep RNN architecture. Unfortunately simple RNNs with many stacked layers can be brittle and difficult to train. This brittleness arises because the backpropagation of gradients within a neural network is a recursive multiplication process. This means that if the gradients are small they will shrink exponentially and if they are large they will grow exponentially. These problems are called the \"vanishing\" and \"exploding\" gradients respectively.",
  "Recurrent Neural Networks have additional recurrent connections compared to regular neural networks that enable them to remember past processed information. These connections however make it more computationally intensive to train a RNN. The parallel processing capabilities of GPUs can accelerate both the training and inference processes of RNNs. cuDNN is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks that optimizes RNN performance on NVIDIA GPUs. TensorRT is a high-performance deep learning inference optimizer and runtime that delivers low latency, high-throughput inference for deep learning applications. Both cuDNN and TensorRT are part of the NVIDIA Deep Learning SDK and support four RNN modes: Simple RNN with ReLU activation function, simple RNN with tanh activation function, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).",
